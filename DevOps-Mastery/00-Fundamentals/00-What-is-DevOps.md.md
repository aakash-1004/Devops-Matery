## What Is It?

DevOps is a **cultural and technical movement** that breaks the wall between Development teams (who write code) and Operations teams (who deploy and maintain it).

Before DevOps:

- Devs write code → throw it over the wall → Ops deploys → something breaks → blame game
- Releases happened every few months, were painful and risky

DevOps fixes this by making both teams **share ownership** of the entire lifecycle.

**Three pillars:**

- **Culture** — shared responsibility, no silos
- **Automation** — CI/CD, IaC, automated testing
- **Measurement** — monitor everything, act on data

## The DevOps Lifecycle

```
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (back to Plan)
```

|Stage|Tools|
|---|---|
|Plan|Jira, Confluence|
|Code|Git, GitHub|
|Build|Maven, Gradle, npm|
|Test|JUnit, Selenium, SonarQube|
|Release/Deploy|Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD|
|Operate|Kubernetes, Docker|
|Monitor|Prometheus, Grafana, ELK|

## Key Concepts

### CI/CD

- **CI (Continuous Integration)** — every commit triggers automated build + test
- **CD (Continuous Delivery)** — code always in deployable state, release is manual trigger
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)** — every passing build goes to production automatically

### DORA Metrics — Know These Cold

|Metric|What it measures|
|---|---|
|**Deployment Frequency**|How often you deploy to production|
|**Lead Time for Changes**|Time from commit to production|
|**Change Failure Rate**|% of deployments that cause incidents|
|**MTTR**|How fast you recover from failure|

### DevOps vs SRE

- **DevOps** — culture + practice. Focus on collaboration and automation
- **SRE** — Google's implementation of DevOps. Treats operations as a software problem, defines SLOs and error budgets

### DevOps vs Agile

- **Agile** — fixes _how_ software is built (short sprints, iterative)
- **DevOps** — fixes _how_ software is delivered and operated
- They complement each other

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. What is DevOps?**

> "DevOps is a culture and set of practices that improves software delivery by combining development and operations responsibilities — automating pipelines, ensuring quality through continuous testing, and maintaining reliability through continuous monitoring."

**Q. What is CI/CD?**

> "CI means every code commit triggers an automated build and test — catching bugs early. CD means the code is always in a deployable state and can be released with a single trigger. Full Continuous Deployment means every passing build automatically goes to production — that requires very mature test coverage."

**Q. What are DORA metrics?**

> "DORA metrics measure DevOps performance — Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, and MTTR. Elite teams deploy multiple times per day with MTTR under an hour."

**Q. How does your current experience relate to DevOps?**

> "In my current role I work with JS7 JobScheduler in production — troubleshooting job failures, managing authentication flows with Keycloak/OIDC, and doing Linux-level log analysis and Bash scripting. That's the Operate and Monitor phase of the DevOps lifecycle. I understand what breaks in production and why — which gives me a strong foundation for building reliable pipelines and infrastructure."

## Real-World Context

Companies like Netflix and Amazon deploy thousands of times per day. That's only possible when dev and ops work as one team with automated pipelines. Without DevOps, you're manually deploying, testing, and monitoring — slow and error-prone.
