## What Is It?

SDLC is a structured process that defines how software is planned, built, tested, and delivered. It ensures every team knows their role and nothing falls through the cracks between business requirements and the final product.

## The Flow — Roles & Responsibilities

```
Customer
   ↓
Business Analyst  →  Gathers requirements
   ↓
Project Manager   →  Plans and prioritizes
   ↓
Product Owner     →  Owns backlog, defines acceptance
   ↓
Solution Architect →  HLD + LLD, tech decisions
   ↓
Scrum Team        →  Builds, tests in sprints
   ↓
DevOps Engineer   →  CI/CD, infra, monitoring, production
   ↓
Running Product in Production
```

## Each Role Explained

### 1. Business Analyst (BA)

- Sits with customer/stakeholder and gathers requirements
- Translates business language into technical requirements
- Produces: **BRD (Business Requirements Document)**

### 2. Project Manager (PM)

- Prioritizes and plans requirements
- Manages timeline, budget, risks
- Produces: **Project plan, sprint roadmap**

### 3. Product Owner (PO)

- Bridges business and technical team
- Owns the **product backlog** — prioritized list of features
- Final say on whether a feature meets acceptance criteria
- Works closely with Scrum team daily

### 4. Solution Architect

- Designs the system architecture
- **HLD (High Level Design)** — overall system structure, tech stack, cloud infra, integrations
- **LLD (Low Level Design)** — component design, DB schemas, API contracts, class diagrams
- Makes decisions like: _"We'll use microservices on AWS EKS, PostgreSQL for DB, Redis for caching"_

### 5. Scrum Team

**Scrum Master**

- Facilitates agile process, removes blockers
- Runs standups, sprint planning, retrospectives

**Developers**

- Pick tasks from sprint backlog, write code, raise PRs
- Work in 2-week sprints

**QA / Testers**

- Write and execute test cases
- Functional, regression, performance testing

### 6. DevOps Engineer — Where You Come In

- Merge triggers **CI pipeline** — build, test, scan
- **CD pipeline** deploys to staging → production
- Manages **infrastructure** the application runs on
- Sets up **monitoring** so the team knows if something breaks

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. What is SDLC and where does DevOps fit?**

> "SDLC is the end-to-end process of delivering software — starting from a Business Analyst gathering requirements, through planning, architecture, agile development in sprints, all the way to DevOps deploying and monitoring in production. DevOps sits at the final and most critical stage — making sure what was built actually runs reliably."

**Q. What is the difference between HLD and LLD?**

> "HLD is the high-level design — it covers overall system architecture, tech stack choices, cloud infrastructure, and how major components integrate. LLD is the low-level design — it goes into the details: database schemas, API contracts, class diagrams, specific algorithms. HLD is for stakeholders and architects, LLD is for developers."

**Q. What is the difference between a Product Owner and a Project Manager?**

> "A Project Manager manages timelines, budgets, and delivery risk. A Product Owner owns the product vision and backlog — they decide what features are built and in what order based on business value. PO works daily with the Scrum team, PM manages the broader delivery."

## Real-World Context

In a real MNC DevOps role, you'll receive infrastructure requirements from the Solution Architect's HLD. You'll provision that infrastructure using Terraform, set up CI/CD pipelines for what developers build, and monitor the running system. Understanding the full SDLC helps you communicate with every team involved.
