## What Is It?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs on top of a real physical machine (the **host**) and behaves exactly like an independent computer with its own OS, CPU, RAM, storage, and network.

The software that makes this possible is called a **Hypervisor**.

## The Stack

```
Physical Hardware  (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)
        ↓
    Hypervisor     (manages and allocates resources)
        ↓
  VM1      VM2      VM3
 (Linux)  (Windows) (Ubuntu)
```

Each VM thinks it owns the hardware. The hypervisor is the traffic cop.

## Two Types of Hypervisors

### Type 1 — Bare Metal

- Runs **directly on hardware** — no host OS in between
- Faster, more efficient, used in **production and data centers**
- Examples: **VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, KVM**
- AWS EC2 uses this under the hood (KVM/Xen)

### Type 2 — Hosted

- Runs **on top of a host OS**
- Easier to set up, used for **development and learning**
- Examples: **VirtualBox, VMware Workstation**
- Your `devops-labs` VM on VirtualBox = Type 2

## Key Concepts

### Snapshot

Point-in-time copy of a VM's state. Roll back if something breaks. Like a save point in a game.

### Clone

Full copy of a VM. Used to spin up identical environments quickly.

### Template / Golden Image

Pre-configured VM image used to launch new VMs consistently. In AWS this is called an **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**.

### CPU & RAM Overcommit

Hypervisors can allocate more virtual CPU/RAM than physically exists — because not all VMs use 100% simultaneously. How cloud providers run thousands of VMs on limited hardware.

### Isolation

Each VM is fully isolated. A crash or compromise in one VM does not affect others.

## VM vs Container — Know This Cold

||Virtual Machine|Container|
|---|---|---|
|**Isolates**|Full OS|Process|
|**Boot time**|Minutes|Seconds|
|**Size**|GBs|MBs|
|**OS**|Each VM has its own OS|Shares host OS kernel|
|**Overhead**|High|Low|
|**Use case**|Full environment isolation|App packaging and deployment|
|**Examples**|EC2, VirtualBox VMs|Docker containers|

**Key point:** In production, containers run **inside** VMs. Kubernetes nodes are VMs (EC2 instances), and pods run as containers on those nodes.

## Where VMs Fit in Real DevOps

- **AWS EC2** — every instance is a VM on AWS's hypervisor
- **Your local lab** — VirtualBox VMs for practice
- **CI/CD runners** — GitHub Actions spins up a fresh VM for every pipeline run
- **Kubernetes nodes** — each node is typically a VM (EC2 instance on AWS)

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. What is a hypervisor and what are its types?**

> "A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines by abstracting physical hardware. Type 1 runs directly on hardware — used in production, examples are ESXi and KVM. Type 2 runs on top of a host OS — used for development, examples are VirtualBox and VMware Workstation."

**Q. What is the difference between a VM and a container?**

> "VMs virtualize the entire hardware stack including the OS, so they're heavier but fully isolated. Containers virtualize at the OS level — they share the host kernel, making them lightweight and fast to start. In modern DevOps we use both — VMs for the underlying infrastructure and containers for running applications on top of them."

**Q. What is an AMI in AWS?**

> "AMI — Amazon Machine Image — is a template used to launch EC2 instances. It contains the OS, pre-installed software, and configuration. It's essentially a golden image for your VM. You can use AWS-provided AMIs or create custom ones with your own configuration baked in."

**Q. When would you choose a VM over a container?**

> "When you need full OS-level isolation — for example running Windows and Linux workloads on the same host, or when a legacy application needs its own kernel. Containers are better for microservices and app packaging, but VMs are better when the isolation boundary needs to be at the OS level."

**Q. What happens when a VM crashes — does it affect others?**

> "No. That's the key benefit of virtualization — full isolation. Each VM has its own OS and resource allocation. A crash in one VM doesn't touch others. The hypervisor manages each independently."

**Q. What is CPU overcommit and is it risky?**

> "Overcommit means allocating more virtual CPUs or RAM than physically exists, based on the assumption that not all VMs peak simultaneously. It's standard in cloud — how AWS sells thousands of instances. It becomes a risk under heavy load when multiple VMs demand resources at the same time, causing contention and performance degradation."
