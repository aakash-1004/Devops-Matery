# Cloud Resource Provisioning

## What Is It?

Provisioning means creating and configuring cloud resources — EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, databases, etc.

There are 4 ways to do this.

---

## The 4 Ways

### 1. Management Console (UI)

Clicking through the AWS web interface to create resources manually.

**Use for:** Learning, exploration, one-off quick tasks **Problem:** Not reproducible, no version control, doesn't scale, high human error risk

---

### 2. CLI (Command Line Interface)

Using `aws cli` commands from the terminal.

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --instance-type t3.micro \
  --key-name my-key \
  --region ap-south-1
```

**Use for:** Quick scripted tasks, simple automations **Problem:**

- Imperative — you tell AWS _how_ to do it step by step
- No state tracking — doesn't know what already exists
- Run it twice = two instances (not idempotent)

---

### 3. SDK (Software Development Kit)

Using programming languages — Python (boto3), Go, JavaScript — to provision resources.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-south-1')
ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId='ami-0abcdef1234567890',
    InstanceType='t3.micro',
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1
)
```

**Use for:** App-driven provisioning, Lambda functions creating resources on events **Problem:** Overkill for standard infra, no built-in state management

---

### 4. Infrastructure as Code — IaC (Terraform / CloudFormation)

Defining infrastructure in **declarative configuration files**.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

Run `terraform apply` — Terraform figures out what exists, what needs to be created, and does it.

**Why this is different:**

- **Declarative** — define _what_ you want, not _how_ to do it
- **State tracking** — Terraform state file knows exactly what it created
- **Idempotent** — run 10 times, still get exactly 1 instance
- **Version controlled** — infrastructure lives in Git like application code
- **Reproducible** — same config creates identical dev, staging, prod environments

## Which to Use — Direct Answer

```
Learning / Exploring     →  Console
Quick one-off task       →  CLI
App-driven automation    →  SDK
Everything else          →  IaC (Terraform)
```

**For a DevOps Engineer — IaC is the standard. Always.**

Console and CLI have no place in production infrastructure management.

## Terraform vs CloudFormation

||Terraform|CloudFormation|
|---|---|---|
|**Cloud support**|Multi-cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)|AWS only|
|**Language**|HCL (simple, readable)|JSON/YAML (verbose)|
|**State management**|Explicit state file|Managed by AWS|
|**Community**|Massive, modules available|Smaller|
|**Portability**|High|Locked to AWS|

**Interview answer:** _"Terraform is preferred because it's cloud-agnostic and has a cleaner syntax. CloudFormation is acceptable if 100% committed to AWS and want AWS to manage state natively."_

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. What are the different ways to provision cloud resources?**

> "There are four ways — the Console, CLI, SDK, and Infrastructure as Code. The Console is fine for learning but has no place in production. CLI works for quick tasks and scripting. SDK is used when provisioning needs to be driven by application logic. But the industry standard for DevOps is IaC — specifically Terraform — because it's declarative, version controlled, idempotent, and reproducible across environments. In any serious company, infrastructure lives in Git just like application code."

**Q. What is idempotency in the context of IaC?**

> "Idempotency means running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. With Terraform, if your config defines one EC2 instance and you run apply 10 times, you still have exactly one instance — it doesn't create duplicates. The CLI doesn't have this property — running the same command twice creates two instances."

**Q. What is Terraform state?**

> "Terraform maintains a state file that maps your configuration to real cloud resources. It's how Terraform knows what already exists vs what needs to be created, updated, or destroyed. In teams, state is stored remotely in S3 with DynamoDB locking to prevent concurrent modifications."

## Real-World Context

In a real DevOps job, you'll use Terraform to provision everything — VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, EKS clusters, RDS databases, S3 buckets. All of it lives in a Git repo, goes through code review, and is applied via CI/CD pipeline. Nobody clicks in the console for production infrastructure.
