## The Kernel

The kernel is the core of the Linux OS — sits between hardware and software, managing CPU, memory, disk, and network on behalf of all running processes.

```
Applications (nginx, python, docker)
        ↓
    Kernel
        ↓
Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)
```

**Key responsibilities:**

- **Process scheduling** — decides which process gets CPU time
- **Memory management** — allocates/deallocates RAM
- **Device drivers** — talks to hardware
- **System calls** — interface between user programs and kernel (read, write, fork, exec)

> Containers share the host kernel — that's why Docker containers are lightweight compared to VMs.

## Filesystem Hierarchy

```
/               Root — everything starts here
├── /bin        Essential binaries (ls, cp, mv)
├── /sbin       System binaries (fdisk, iptables)
├── /etc        Configuration files (nginx.conf, /etc/hosts)
├── /var        Variable data — logs (/var/log), spool files
├── /home       User home directories
├── /root       Root user's home
├── /tmp        Temporary files — cleared on reboot
├── /opt        Optional/third-party software
├── /proc       Virtual filesystem — live kernel/process info
├── /sys        Virtual filesystem — hardware/kernel info
├── /dev        Device files (disks, terminals)
└── /usr        User programs and libraries
```

> `/proc` and `/sys` are not real files — they're kernel data structures exposed as files. `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, `cat /proc/meminfo` — live system data, no disk read.

## Processes

Every running program is a process with a **PID (Process ID)**.

```bash
ps aux                    # all running processes
ps aux | grep nginx       # find specific process
pgrep nginx               # get PID directly
kill -9 <PID>             # force kill (SIGKILL)
kill -15 <PID>            # graceful termination (SIGTERM)
```

### Process States

|State|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`R`|Running|
|`S`|Sleeping (waiting for event)|
|`D`|Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O wait)|
|`Z`|Zombie (finished, parent hasn't cleaned up)|
|`T`|Stopped|

### Foreground vs Background

```bash
./script.sh &             # run in background
jobs                      # list background jobs
fg 1                      # bring job 1 to foreground
nohup ./script.sh &       # survives terminal close
```

---

## File Permissions

```bash
-rwxr-xr--  1  aakash  devops  1024  May 12  script.sh
```

```
- rwx r-x r--
│  │   │   │
│  │   │   └── Others: read only
│  │   └──── Group: read + execute
│  └──────── Owner: read + write + execute
└─────────── File type (- file, d directory, l symlink)
```

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh       # rwxr-xr-x
chmod +x script.sh        # add execute bit
chown aakash:devops file  # change owner and group
```

**Numeric chmod:** 4=read, 2=write, 1=execute → 7=rwx, 5=r-x, 4=r--

### Soft Link vs Hard Link

```bash
ln -s /original /link     # soft link — pointer to path, breaks if original deleted
ln /original /link        # hard link — pointer to inode, survives original deletion
```

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. What is the Linux kernel?**

> "The kernel is the core of the OS — it sits between hardware and applications, managing CPU scheduling, memory allocation, device drivers, and system calls. When you run a Docker container, it shares the host kernel — that's why containers are lightweight compared to VMs which each have their own kernel."

**Q. What is a zombie process?**

> "A zombie process has finished executing but still has an entry in the process table because its parent hasn't called wait() to read its exit status. It consumes no CPU or memory — just a PID. Fix: find and fix the parent process, or kill the parent."

**Q. What does /proc contain?**

> "/proc is a virtual filesystem exposing live kernel and process data as files. /proc/cpuinfo shows CPU details, /proc/meminfo shows memory, /proc/PID/fd shows open file descriptors of a process. Extremely useful for live troubleshooting."

**Q. Difference between soft link and hard link?**

> "A soft link points to a file path — if the original is deleted, the link breaks. A hard link points to the same inode — the data persists even if the original filename is deleted. In DevOps, symlinks are commonly used for config management and version switching."
