## curl — HTTP Requests from Terminal

```bash
curl https://example.com                          # GET request
curl -I https://example.com                       # headers only
curl -X POST -d '{"key":"val"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.example.com/endpoint                # POST with JSON body
curl -o output.html https://example.com           # save response to file
curl -u user:pass https://example.com             # basic auth
curl -k https://self-signed.example.com           # skip SSL verification
```

**Real world:** Testing if a service is reachable from inside a pod or container — curl is your first tool.

## ss / netstat — Network Connections

`ss` is modern and faster. `netstat` is older but still widely known.

```bash
ss -tuln                  # all listening TCP/UDP ports
ss -tulnp                 # same + process name
ss -s                     # summary statistics
netstat -tulnp            # equivalent older command
netstat -an | grep :8080  # check if port 8080 is in use
```

**Flags breakdown:**

| Flag | Meaning                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| `-t` | TCP connections                   |
| `-u` | UDP connections                   |
| `-l` | Listening sockets only            |
| `-n` | Numeric (don't resolve hostnames) |
| `-p` | Show process name and PID         |

**Real world:** First thing to check when a service isn't responding — is it actually listening on the expected port?

## iptables — Linux Firewall

```bash
iptables -L                                          # list all rules
iptables -L -n -v                                    # verbose with packet counts
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT        # allow port 80
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT        # allow SSH
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP                            # drop everything else
iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT        # delete a rule
iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules                  # persist rules
```

### All Flags Explained

| Flag      | Full Form        | Meaning                                 |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `-A`      | Append           | Add rule to **end** of chain            |
| `-I`      | Insert           | Add rule to **top** of chain            |
| `-D`      | Delete           | Remove matching rule                    |
| `-L`      | List             | List all rules                          |
| `-F`      | Flush            | Delete all rules in chain               |
| `-p`      | Protocol         | `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, `all`             |
| `--dport` | Destination Port | Port traffic is going **to**            |
| `--sport` | Source Port      | Port traffic is coming **from**         |
| `-j`      | Jump             | **Action** to take when rule matches    |
| `-n`      | Numeric          | Show IPs/ports as numbers               |
| `-v`      | Verbose          | Show packet/byte counts                 |
| `-s`      | Source           | Match traffic from specific IP          |
| `-d`      | Destination      | Match traffic to specific IP            |
| `-i`      | In-interface     | Traffic coming in on specific interface |
| `-o`      | Out-interface    | Traffic going out on specific interface |

### The `-j` Jump Target Values

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`ACCEPT`|Allow the packet|
|`DROP`|Silently discard — sender gets no response, waits for timeout|
|`REJECT`|Discard and send error back to sender — faster failure|
|`LOG`|Log packet to syslog, then continue|
|`RETURN`|Stop processing current chain|

> **DROP vs REJECT:** Use DROP on public-facing interfaces — don't reveal your firewall exists. Use REJECT internally for faster debugging.

### Rule Order Matters — First Match Wins

```bash
# CORRECT — specific rules before catch-all
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP           # catch-all at end

# WRONG — DROP fires first, port 80 never reached
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

### The Three Chains

|Chain|Traffic|
|---|---|
|`INPUT`|Coming **into** the host|
|`OUTPUT`|Leaving the host|
|`FORWARD`|Passing **through** (routing)|

### Practical Examples

```bash
# Allow SSH only from specific IP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 203.0.113.10 -j ACCEPT

# Allow loopback interface
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow established/return traffic
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

> Without `ESTABLISHED,RELATED` your server can't receive responses to its own outbound requests.

> Kubernetes uses iptables heavily — every Service ClusterIP, NodePort, and NetworkPolicy is implemented via iptables rules under the hood.

## dig / nslookup — DNS Lookup

```bash
dig google.com                    # full DNS lookup
dig google.com +short             # just the IP
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com          # query specific DNS server
nslookup google.com               # simpler alternative
```

**Real world:** Debugging DNS inside Kubernetes — exec into a pod and run dig against the CoreDNS service.

## Other Essential Commands

```bash
ping google.com                   # basic connectivity check
traceroute google.com             # trace network path hop by hop
ip addr show                      # show IP addresses on all interfaces
ip route show                     # show routing table
nc -zv 192.168.1.1 8080          # test TCP connectivity to a port
wget https://example.com/file     # download a file
```

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. How do you check which process is using port 8080?**

```bash
ss -tulnp | grep 8080
# or
lsof -i :8080
```

**Q. What is the difference between netstat and ss?**

> "Both show network connections and listening ports. ss is the modern replacement — it reads directly from kernel socket structures making it faster. netstat is deprecated on most modern Linux systems but still widely used."

**Q. A service is running but not reachable. How do you troubleshoot?**

> "Systematic approach — first check if the service is actually listening with ss -tulnp. Then check firewall rules with iptables -L. Then check if reachable locally with curl localhost:PORT. Then check DNS with dig. Then check routing with ip route show. Layer by layer."

**Q. What is the difference between DROP and REJECT in iptables?**

> "DROP silently discards the packet — the sender waits for a timeout and gets no response. REJECT sends an error back immediately. Use DROP on public-facing interfaces so you don't reveal your firewall exists. Use REJECT internally for faster debugging."
