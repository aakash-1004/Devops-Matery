## Variables

```bash
NAME="Aakash"
echo $NAME
echo "Hello ${NAME}"         # safer syntax inside strings

readonly PI=3.14             # cannot be changed
export DB_HOST="localhost"   # environment variable (available to child processes)
```

---

## Special Variables

|Variable|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`$0`|Script name|
|`$1 $2`|Positional arguments|
|`$#`|Number of arguments|
|`$@`|All arguments (preserves boundaries)|
|`$?`|Exit code of last command (0 = success)|
|`$$`|PID of current script|
|`$!`|PID of last background process|

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script: $0"
echo "First arg: $1"
echo "All args: $@"
echo "Arg count: $#"
```

---

## Conditionals

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ $1 -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Greater than 10"
elif [ $1 -eq 10 ]; then
    echo "Equal to 10"
else
    echo "Less than 10"
fi
```

### Comparison Operators

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`-eq`|Equal|
|`-ne`|Not equal|
|`-gt`|Greater than|
|`-lt`|Less than|
|`-ge`|Greater or equal|
|`-le`|Less or equal|
|`-z`|String is empty|
|`-n`|String is not empty|
|`-f`|File exists and is a file|
|`-d`|Directory exists|

---

## Loops

```bash
# for loop over list
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done

# range
for i in {1..10}; do
    echo $i
done

# while loop
COUNT=0
while [ $COUNT -lt 5 ]; do
    COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
    echo "Count: $COUNT"
done

# loop over files
for file in /var/log/*.log; do
    echo "Processing: $file"
done
```

---

## Functions

```bash
#!/bin/bash

greet() {
    local NAME=$1           # local — only visible inside function
    echo "Hello, $NAME"
}

check_service() {
    local SERVICE=$1
    if systemctl is-active --quiet $SERVICE; then
        echo "$SERVICE is running"
    else
        echo "$SERVICE is NOT running"
        return 1            # non-zero = failure
    fi
}

greet "Aakash"
check_service "nginx"
```

---

## Safety Flags — Always Use These

```bash
set -e          # exit immediately on any error
set -u          # treat unset variables as errors
set -o pipefail # catch errors in pipes
set -x          # debug mode — print each command before executing
```

Combined: `set -euo pipefail` — put this at the top of every production script.

---

## Real-World Scripts

### Health Check

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

SERVICES=("nginx" "docker" "sshd")
FAILED=()

for SERVICE in "${SERVICES[@]}"; do
    if ! systemctl is-active --quiet $SERVICE; then
        FAILED+=($SERVICE)
    fi
done

if [ ${#FAILED[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "All services healthy"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Failed services: ${FAILED[@]}"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Log Cleanup

```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOG_DIR="/var/log/myapp"
DAYS=7

find $LOG_DIR -name "*.log" -mtime +$DAYS -exec rm -f {} \;
echo "Cleaned logs older than $DAYS days"
```

---

## Cron — Scheduled Jobs

```bash
crontab -e        # edit cron jobs
crontab -l        # list cron jobs
crontab -r        # remove all cron jobs
```

### Cron Syntax

```
* * * * * command
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └── Day of week (0-7, Sunday=0 or 7)
│ │ │ └──── Month (1-12)
│ │ └────── Day of month (1-31)
│ └──────── Hour (0-23)
└────────── Minute (0-59)
```

### Examples

```bash
0 2 * * *     /scripts/backup.sh          # every day at 2am
*/5 * * * *   /scripts/health_check.sh    # every 5 minutes
0 0 * * 0     /scripts/cleanup.sh         # every Sunday midnight
0 9 * * 1-5   /scripts/report.sh          # weekdays at 9am
```

> Connection to JS7: Cron is Linux-native job scheduling. JS7 is the enterprise version of this — same concept, more features (dependencies, error handling, retry logic, audit trail).

## Debugging Scripts

```bash
bash -x script.sh           # run with debug output
set -x                      # enable debug inside script
```

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. What is the difference between $@ and $*?**

> "Both represent all script arguments. The difference appears when quoted — $@ treats each argument as a separate quoted string, $* treats all arguments as one string. Always use $@ to preserve argument boundaries."

**Q. What does exit code 0 mean?**

> "Exit code 0 means success. Any non-zero exit code means failure. This is critical in CI/CD — pipelines check exit codes to decide if a step passed or failed. Always end scripts with explicit exit codes."

**Q. What is set -e and why is it important?**

> "set -e makes the script exit immediately if any command fails instead of silently continuing. Without it, a script can continue past failures and cause unpredictable behavior. In production scripts always use set -euo pipefail at the top."

**Q. How do you debug a shell script?**

> "Two ways — run it with bash -x script.sh which prints each command before executing, or add set -x inside the script. For catching errors, set -e exits on failure and set -o pipefail catches errors inside pipes."
