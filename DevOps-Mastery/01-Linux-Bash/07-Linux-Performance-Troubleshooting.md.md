## top / htop — Live System Monitor

```bash
top             # live process monitor
htop            # better version — color, mouse support, easier to read
```

### Key Columns in top

|Column|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`PID`|Process ID|
|`%CPU`|CPU usage|
|`%MEM`|Memory usage|
|`VSZ`|Virtual memory size (reserved)|
|`RSS`|Resident Set Size — actual RAM in use|
|`STAT`|Process state|

### Key Shortcuts

|Key|Action|
|---|---|
|`k`|Kill a process|
|`M`|Sort by memory|
|`P`|Sort by CPU|
|`1`|Show per-core CPU usage|
|`q`|Quit|

## vmstat — System Performance Snapshot

```bash
vmstat 1 5          # print stats every 1 second, 5 times
```

```
procs  memory      swap  io    system  cpu
r  b   swpd  free  si so bi bo  in  cs us sy id wa
1  0   0   512000  0  0 10  5  100 200  5  2 90  3
```

### Key Columns

|Column|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`r`|Processes **waiting for CPU** — if consistently > CPU count, CPU is bottleneck|
|`b`|Processes in uninterruptible sleep (I/O wait)|
|`wa`|CPU time waiting on I/O — if high, disk is bottleneck|
|`si/so`|Swap in/out — if non-zero, RAM is exhausted|
|`us`|User CPU time|
|`sy`|System/kernel CPU time|
|`id`|Idle CPU time|

## iotop — Disk I/O Per Process

```bash
iotop               # live disk I/O monitor
iotop -o            # show only processes actively doing I/O
```

**Real world:** When server is slow and CPU looks fine — check iotop. A rogue process hammering disk is a common culprit.

## lsof — List Open Files

In Linux, everything is a file — including network sockets.

```bash
lsof -i :8080           # what process is using port 8080
lsof -p <PID>           # all files opened by a process
lsof -u aakash          # all files opened by user
lsof /var/log/app.log   # who has this log file open
lsof -i tcp             # all TCP connections
lsof | grep deleted     # files deleted but still held open
```

**Real world:** Trying to delete a log file but disk space not freed — a process still holds it open. `lsof | grep deleted` finds it. Restart that process to reclaim space.

---

## strace — System Call Tracer

```bash
strace ls                         # trace system calls of ls command
strace -p <PID>                   # attach to a running process
strace -e trace=open,read ls      # trace specific calls only
strace -o output.txt ls           # save output to file
```

**Real world:** Process is hanging and you don't know why — `strace -p PID` shows exactly which system call it's stuck on. Deep debugging tool.

---

## dmesg — Kernel Messages

```bash
dmesg                   # all kernel messages
dmesg | tail -50        # last 50 messages
dmesg | grep -i error   # filter errors
dmesg | grep -i kill    # find OOM kills
dmesg -T                # human readable timestamps
```

**Real world:** OOM (Out of Memory) killer events show up here. If a container or process gets killed unexpectedly, dmesg tells you.

---

## free — Memory Usage

```bash
free -h             # human readable (MB/GB)
```

```
              total    used    free   shared  buff/cache  available
Mem:           7.7G    2.1G    1.2G    200M      4.4G        5.2G
Swap:          2.0G    0.0G    2.0G
```

> **`available` is what matters — not `free`.** Linux uses RAM aggressively for disk cache. Available = free + cache that can be reclaimed instantly. If swap is in use (si/so non-zero), RAM is actually exhausted — that's a real problem.

---

## df and du — Disk Usage

```bash
df -h                               # disk space by filesystem
du -sh /var/log                     # total size of directory
du -sh /*                           # size of each top-level directory
du -sh * | sort -rh | head -10      # top 10 largest items
```

**Real world:** Disk full alert fires in production — first command is `df -h`, then `du -sh` to find what's eating space.

## Troubleshooting Methodology

When a server is slow or a service is down, use this systematic approach:

```
1. CPU      →  top / htop — high %CPU process?
2. Memory   →  free -h — swap in use?
3. Disk I/O →  iotop -o — disk being hammered?
4. Network  →  ss -tulnp — service listening? connections?
5. Disk     →  df -h — disk full?
6. Kernel   →  dmesg | grep -i error — OOM kills? hardware errors?
```

Never skip steps. The bottleneck is often not where you expect it.

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q. A server is slow. How do you troubleshoot?**

> "Systematic approach — check CPU first with top or htop. If CPU is high, identify the process. If CPU is fine, check memory with free -h — if swap is being used, RAM is exhausted. Then check I/O with iotop — disk bottleneck is common. Check network with ss. Then check disk space with df -h. Finally check kernel messages with dmesg for OOM kills or hardware errors. Layer by layer, never assume."

**Q. What is the difference between VSZ and RSS?**

> "VSZ is virtual memory — total address space a process has reserved, including memory it hasn't actually used yet. RSS is Resident Set Size — actual physical RAM currently in use. RSS is the real number to watch for memory pressure."

**Q. How do you find which process is consuming the most memory?**

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
```

**Q. Disk is full but you can't find large files. What do you do?**

> "Files can be deleted but still held open by a process — the space isn't freed until the process releases the file descriptor. Use `lsof | grep deleted` to find processes holding deleted files open. Restart those processes to reclaim the space."

**Q. What does load average mean in top?**

> "Load average shows the average number of processes waiting for CPU over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. A load average equal to the number of CPU cores means the system is fully utilized. Above that means processes are queuing for CPU. Rule of thumb — if load average consistently exceeds core count, you have a CPU bottleneck."

**Q. What is the OOM killer?**

> "The Out of Memory killer is a Linux kernel mechanism that kills processes when the system runs out of RAM. It selects processes based on a score — typically the largest memory consumer. You'll see it in dmesg as 'Out of memory: Kill process'. In Kubernetes, this maps to pod OOMKilled status."
