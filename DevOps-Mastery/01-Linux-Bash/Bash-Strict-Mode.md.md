**Status:** ✅ Understood
**Interview Relevance:** 🔴 High — asked in almost every DevOps interview

## What Is It?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
```

| Flag | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `-e` | Exit immediately if any command returns non-zero |
| `-u` | Treat unset variables as errors — prevents silent bugs |
| `-o pipefail` | If any command in a pipe fails, the whole pipe fails |

## Why It Matters

Without this, bash silently continues on errors. In production, silent failures = undetected incidents.

**Example without `-e`:**
```bash
cp /nonexistent/file /tmp/   # fails silently
echo "done"                  # still runs — you'd never know it failed
```

**With `-e`:** script exits immediately at the failed `cp`.

## Conditionals

### String / File checks → use `[[ ]]`
```bash
if [[ -f "$FILE" ]]; then ...       # file exists and is regular file
if [[ -z "$VAR" ]]; then ...        # string is empty
if [[ "$A" == "$B" ]]; then ...     # string equality
if [[ -d "$DIR" ]]; then ...        # directory exists
```

### Arithmetic → use `(( ))`
```bash
if (( CPU_USAGE > 80 )); then ...
if (( COUNT == 0 )); then ...
(( TOTAL++ ))                       # increment
```

### Never use `[ ]` for new scripts
Old POSIX syntax. `[[ ]]` handles spaces in variables safely, no word splitting issues.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "Why do you use `set -euo pipefail` in bash scripts?"**

> "`-e` makes the script exit on any error so failures don't go unnoticed. `-u` catches typos in variable names — without it, an unset variable is just treated as empty which can cause silent bugs. `pipefail` is the one people forget — without it, a failed command in a pipe is masked by the last command's exit code. Together they make bash behave more like a real programming language."
