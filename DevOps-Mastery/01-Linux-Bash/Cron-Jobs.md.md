## Cron Syntax

```
MIN  HOUR  DOM  MON  DOW  COMMAND
 *    *     *    *    *   /path/to/script.sh
```

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| MIN | 0–59 |
| HOUR | 0–23 |
| DOM | 1–31 (day of month) |
| MON | 1–12 |
| DOW | 0–7 (0 and 7 = Sunday) |

**Common patterns:**
```bash
*/5 * * * *          # every 5 minutes
0 * * * *            # every hour (at :00)
0 2 * * *            # every day at 2am
0 2 * * 0            # every Sunday at 2am
0 9 * * 1-5          # weekdays at 9am
```

## Setting Up a Cron Job

```bash
crontab -e           # edit current user's crontab
crontab -l           # list current user's crontab
sudo crontab -e      # edit root's crontab
```

**Health check every 5 minutes:**
```bash
*/5 * * * * /home/aakash/devops/health_check.sh >> /tmp/health_cron.log 2>&1
```

- `>>` → append stdout to log file
- `2>&1` → redirect stderr to same place as stdout

## Critical Gotchas

**1. No $PATH in cron**
Cron runs with a minimal environment. Commands like `docker`, `python3`, `kubectl` won't be found unless you use full paths.

```bash
# Wrong in cron
docker ps

# Right
/usr/bin/docker ps
```

Find full path: `which docker`

**2. Always use absolute paths for the script itself**
```bash
# Wrong
*/5 * * * * ./health_check.sh

# Right
*/5 * * * * /home/aakash/devops/health_check.sh
```

**3. Test manually before scheduling**
Always run `bash /path/to/script.sh` manually first. A script that works interactively can fail in cron due to missing env vars.

## Verify Cron Is Running

```bash
sudo systemctl status cron
grep CRON /var/log/syslog | tail -20
```

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "You've scheduled a bash script in cron but it's not running. How do you debug it?"**

> "First I check if the cron daemon is running with `systemctl status cron`. Then I look at `/var/log/syslog` and grep for CRON to see if it's even being triggered. If it's triggered but failing, the most common cause is PATH — cron has a minimal environment, so commands like `docker` or `python3` aren't found. I fix this by using absolute paths for every command, or by explicitly setting PATH at the top of the script. I also make sure the script has execute permissions and the log redirection includes `2>&1` so I can see errors."
