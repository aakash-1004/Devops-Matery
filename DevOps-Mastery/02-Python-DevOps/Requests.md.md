# Python — requests

**Tags:** #python #devops #api #day1
**Status:** ✅ Understood
**Interview Relevance:** 🟡 Medium — used for API interactions, webhooks, health checks

## What Is It?

`requests` is Python's HTTP library. Used to hit REST APIs — Kubernetes API, GitHub API, Slack webhooks, monitoring endpoints, cloud provider APIs.

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## Basic Usage

```python
import requests

# GET request
response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/json")
print(response.status_code)   # 200
print(response.json())        # parsed JSON as dict
```

**Common response attributes:**

| Attribute | What It Returns |
|-----------|----------------|
| `response.status_code` | HTTP status (200, 404, 500) |
| `response.json()` | Parsed JSON body as dict |
| `response.text` | Raw response as string |
| `response.headers` | Response headers |

---

## With Headers & Auth

```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer my-token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/pods", headers=headers)
```

---

## POST Request

```python
import requests, json

payload = {"text": "🚨 High CPU alert on prod-server-1"}
response = requests.post(
    "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL",
    data=json.dumps(payload)
)
print(response.status_code)
```

This is exactly how you'd send a Slack alert from your health check script.

---

## Error Handling

```python
try:
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/health", timeout=5)
    response.raise_for_status()   # raises exception for 4xx/5xx
    print("Service healthy")
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("Request timed out")
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    print(f"HTTP error: {e}")
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    print("Could not connect")
```

Always set `timeout` — without it, a hung request will block your script forever.

## Real DevOps Connection

**Kubernetes API:**
```python
response = requests.get(
    "https://k8s-api/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)
pods = response.json()["items"]
for pod in pods:
    print(pod["metadata"]["name"])
```

**GitHub API — list repos:**
```python
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.github.com/user/repos",
    headers={"Authorization": f"token {github_token}"}
)
for repo in response.json():
    print(repo["name"])
```

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "How would you send an alert to Slack when a health check fails?"**

> "I'd use the `requests` library to POST to a Slack incoming webhook URL. The payload is a JSON body with a `text` field containing the alert message. I'd wrap it in a try/except with a timeout so a slow Slack API doesn't block the health check script. In production I'd store the webhook URL as an environment variable, never hardcoded."
