# Git Workflow for Real Teams

**Tags:** #git #devops #version-control #day2
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Interview Relevance:** 🔴 High — Git workflow is tested in every DevOps interview

## The Branching Strategy

```
main       → production code. Never commit directly here.
develop    → integration branch (optional in small teams)
feature/xx → one branch per feature or fix
```

```
main
 └── feature/add-auth
 └── feature/task-priority
 └── fix/memory-leak
```

**Rule:** Every change goes through a branch → PR → merge. Never `git push` directly to main.

---

## The Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 3. Make changes, stage, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe what you did"

# 4. Push branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature

# 5. Create PR on GitHub → get review → merge

# 6. Clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-feature   # delete local branch
```

---

## Commit Message Convention

Companies use **Conventional Commits** — interviewers notice this:

```
feat: add health check endpoint
fix: resolve memory leak in task worker
docs: update README with setup instructions
chore: add .gitignore
refactor: extract DB connection to separate module
test: add unit tests for task creation
```

Format: `type: short description (present tense, lowercase)`

## Essential Git Commands

```bash
# Status & history
git status                        # what's changed
git log --oneline                 # compact commit history
git log --oneline --all           # all branches
git diff                          # unstaged changes
git diff --staged                 # staged changes

# Branching
git branch                        # list local branches
git branch -a                     # list all branches including remote
git checkout -b feature/xyz       # create and switch to new branch
git checkout main                 # switch to main
git branch -d feature/xyz         # delete local branch after merge

# Remote
git remote -v                     # show remote URLs
git fetch origin                  # fetch changes without merging
git pull origin main              # fetch + merge
git push origin feature/xyz       # push branch to remote

# Undoing things
git restore filename              # discard unstaged changes
git restore --staged filename     # unstage a file
git commit --amend -m "new msg"   # fix last commit message (before push only)
git reset --soft HEAD~1           # undo last commit, keep changes staged
```

## .gitignore — What to Always Ignore

```gitignore
# Python
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
.env

# Secrets — NEVER commit these
*.key
*.pem
.env.local
secrets.yaml

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
```

---

## requirements.txt — Python Dependency File

```bash
# Generate from active venv (always activate venv first)
source venv/bin/activate
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Install from requirements.txt (on a new machine or in Docker)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why it matters:** Without this file, nobody (including Docker) can reproduce your Python environment. This is required for Dockerizing any Python app.

**Important:** Always run `pip freeze` from inside the venv, not system Python — otherwise you get all Ubuntu system packages mixed in.

---

## Authentication — Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub no longer accepts passwords for Git operations. Use a PAT:

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Check `repo` scope fully
3. Generate and copy token
4. Use as password when prompted

Save credentials so you don't enter them every time:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

---

## What Happens in a PR

1. Developer pushes feature branch
2. Opens Pull Request on GitHub — base: `main` ← compare: `feature/xyz`
3. Team reviews the diff (changed lines)
4. Reviewer approves or requests changes
5. Merge — options:
   - **Merge commit** → preserves all commits (default)
   - **Squash merge** → combines all commits into one (cleaner history)
   - **Rebase** → replays commits on top of main (linear history)

Most companies use **squash merge** for feature branches.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Committed to main directly | `git reset --soft HEAD~1` then create a branch |
| Committed secrets/passwords | Remove, rotate the secret, use `.gitignore` |
| Named file same as stdlib module | Rename the file |
| `pip freeze` from system Python | Always activate venv first |

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "Walk me through your Git workflow on a real project."**

> "I never commit directly to main. For every feature or fix, I create a branch from the latest main using `git checkout -b feature/name`. I make commits with conventional commit messages — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` — so the history is readable. When the feature is ready I push the branch and open a PR on GitHub. After review and approval it gets squash-merged into main and the feature branch is deleted. On my local machine I pull main and delete the local branch. This keeps main always deployable and the history clean."

**Q: "How do you handle merge conflicts?"**

> "When two branches modify the same lines, Git can't auto-merge. I run `git pull origin main` on my feature branch to bring in the latest changes. Git marks the conflicting sections with `<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>`. I manually edit the file to keep the correct version, then `git add` the resolved file and `git commit` to complete the merge. The key is resolving conflicts on the feature branch before merging to main, not the other way around."
