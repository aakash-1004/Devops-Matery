## The Problem Docker Solves

Before Docker, deploying software was painful. A developer would write code on their MacBook, it would work perfectly, then fail on the Linux production server because:
- Different Python/Node/Java versions
- Different OS libraries
- Different environment variables
- Missing dependencies

The classic "works on my machine" problem.

**Virtual Machines** were one solution — spin up a full Linux VM for every app. But VMs are heavy: each one needs its own OS kernel, taking gigabytes of RAM and minutes to start.

**Docker** solved this differently. Instead of virtualizing hardware, it virtualizes at the OS level — apps share the host kernel but are isolated from each other in lightweight containers that start in seconds and use megabytes instead of gigabytes.

---

## Containers vs Virtual Machines

Understanding this distinction is fundamental — interviewers ask it constantly.

### Virtual Machine Architecture

```
Physical Hardware
      │
      ▼
Host OS (Windows/Linux/Mac)
      │
      ▼
Hypervisor (VMware/VirtualBox/KVM)
      │
      ├── VM 1: Guest OS + App A
      ├── VM 2: Guest OS + App B
      └── VM 3: Guest OS + App C
```

Each VM carries a full OS — typically 1-2GB just for the OS. Starting a VM takes 1-2 minutes. Total overhead for 3 VMs might be 6GB of RAM just for operating systems.

### Container Architecture

```
Physical Hardware
      │
      ▼
Host OS (Linux kernel)
      │
      ▼
Docker Engine (Container Runtime)
      │
      ├── Container 1: App A (shares kernel)
      ├── Container 2: App B (shares kernel)
      └── Container 3: App C (shares kernel)
```

Containers share the host OS kernel — no duplicate OS. Starting a container takes milliseconds. Total overhead is megabytes, not gigabytes.

### Key Differences

| Feature | Virtual Machine | Docker Container |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| OS | Full guest OS per VM | Shares host OS kernel |
| Size | GBs (includes OS) | MBs (app + deps only) |
| Startup time | Minutes | Milliseconds |
| Isolation | Strong (hardware level) | Good (OS level) |
| Portability | Lower | Higher |
| Resource usage | Heavy | Lightweight |
| Use case | Full OS isolation needed | App deployment, microservices |

**Important nuance:** On Mac and Windows, Docker actually runs a small Linux VM behind the scenes (because containers need a Linux kernel). But on Linux servers — which is where production runs — there's no VM overhead at all.

## How Docker Achieves Isolation

Docker uses two Linux kernel features to isolate containers from each other:

### Namespaces — "What can I see?"

Namespaces give each container its own isolated view of the system. There are 6 types:

- **PID namespace** — each container has its own process IDs. Container's PID 1 is not visible to the host as PID 1
- **Network namespace** — each container gets its own network interfaces, IP address, routing table
- **Mount namespace** — each container has its own filesystem view
- **UTS namespace** — each container can have its own hostname
- **IPC namespace** — isolated inter-process communication
- **User namespace** — isolated user/group IDs

### Control Groups (cgroups) — "How much can I use?"

Cgroups limit and track resource usage per container:
- How much CPU it can use
- How much RAM it can use
- How much disk I/O it gets
- How much network bandwidth it gets

This is why `docker run --memory=512m` works — cgroups enforce the limit at the kernel level.

```

### Docker Client

The interface you interact with. When you type `docker run nginx`, you're using the Docker client. It translates your commands into REST API calls sent to the Docker daemon.

The client and daemon can run on the same machine (typical) or different machines (Docker remote).

### Docker Daemon (dockerd)

The background service that does all the actual work. It:
- Listens for API requests from the Docker client
- Manages images, containers, networks, and volumes
- Communicates with the container runtime (containerd) to start/stop containers
- Communicates with registries to push/pull images

### Docker Registry

A storage and distribution system for Docker images. When you run `docker pull nginx`, the daemon downloads the image from the registry.

**Docker Hub** is the default public registry. You can also use:
- **AWS ECR** (Elastic Container Registry) — private registry on AWS
- **Google GCR** — Google's container registry
- **GitHub Container Registry** — integrated with GitHub
- **Self-hosted registry** — run your own with `docker run registry`

## Docker Engine vs Docker Daemon

These terms are often confused:

| | Docker Engine | Docker Daemon |
|--|---------------|---------------|
| What is it? | Complete Docker platform | Background service only |
| Includes | CLI + REST API + Daemon | Only `dockerd` process |
| Role | Full system users interact with | Executes container operations |
| Runs in background? | No (it's a system/platform) | Yes |

Simple way to remember: Docker Engine is the whole car. Docker Daemon is just the engine inside the car.

## The Docker Object Hierarchy

Understanding how these four objects relate to each other is the foundation of everything else:

```
Dockerfile
    │ docker build
    ▼
Docker Image (read-only template/blueprint)
    │ docker run
    ▼
Docker Container (running instance)
    │
    ├── uses Volumes (persistent storage)
    └── uses Networks (communication)
```

**Dockerfile** → instructions for building an image (like a recipe)

**Docker Image** → the packaged result (like a frozen meal — ready to heat)

**Docker Container** → a running instance of an image (the meal, heated and ready to eat)

You can run 10 containers from the same image simultaneously — each gets its own isolated filesystem, network, and processes.

---

## Image Layers — How Docker Storage Works

Every Docker image is made of **layers** — read-only snapshots stacked on top of each other. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates one layer.

```
Layer 5: COPY . .                 (your application code)
Layer 4: RUN pip install -r ...   (dependencies installed)
Layer 3: COPY requirements.txt .  (requirements file)
Layer 2: WORKDIR /app             (directory created)
Layer 1: FROM python:3.12-slim    (base OS + Python)
```

**Why layers matter:**

1. **Caching** — if a layer hasn't changed, Docker reuses the cached version. Rebuilding after changing only your app code skips all the dependency installation layers
2. **Sharing** — if 10 images all use `FROM python:3.12-slim`, that base layer is stored once on disk and shared
3. **Fast downloads** — when pulling an updated image, only changed layers are downloaded

When a container runs, Docker adds a thin **writable layer** on top of the read-only image layers. All changes the container makes (files created, logs written) go into this writable layer. When the container is deleted, this writable layer is gone — which is why you need volumes for persistent data.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What is Docker and why do companies use it?"**
> "Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications with all their dependencies into isolated containers. Before Docker, deployment was fragile because different environments had different OS versions, libraries, and configurations. Docker solves this by bundling everything the app needs into a portable image that runs identically on any machine. Companies use it because it makes deployments reproducible, environments consistent from dev to production, and enables microservices architectures where each service runs in its own container."

**Q: "What's the difference between a container and a virtual machine?"**
> "VMs virtualize hardware — each VM runs a full OS kernel, which means gigabytes of overhead and minute-long startup times. Containers virtualize at the OS level using Linux namespaces and cgroups — they share the host kernel, have no duplicate OS, start in milliseconds, and use megabytes instead of gigabytes. The tradeoff is isolation strength — VMs have stronger hardware-level isolation, while containers share the kernel. In practice, containers are preferred for application deployment because of their efficiency."

**Q: "What is a Docker image layer and why does it matter?"**
> "Every instruction in a Dockerfile creates a read-only layer. Layers stack to form the complete image. They matter because of caching — if I change my app code but not the dependencies, Docker reuses all the cached layers up to the `COPY . .` instruction and only rebuilds from there. This turns a 3-minute build into a 5-second rebuild. Layers also enable sharing — if 50 different images all use the same base image, that base layer is stored once on disk."
