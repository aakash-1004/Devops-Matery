## What Problem Does Docker Compose Solve?

As soon as you move beyond a single container, managing Docker becomes painful. A real application typically needs:
- A web server or API
- A database
- A cache layer (Redis)
- A message queue
- Maybe a background worker

Without Compose, you'd run a separate `docker run` command for each, manually manage a network between them, define volumes, set environment variables, handle startup order, and remember all the flags. That's 6+ complex commands that need to be run in the right order every time.

Docker Compose replaces all of that with a single YAML file and one command: `docker compose up`.

```bash
# Without Compose — managing 3 services manually
docker network create app-network
docker volume create db-data
docker run -d --name db --network app-network -v db-data:/data/db -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin mongo:4.4
docker run -d --name redis --network app-network redis:7
docker run -d --name api --network app-network -p 5000:5000 -e MONGO_URI=mongodb://admin@db:27017/ my-api:latest

# With Compose — same result
docker compose up -d
```

Beyond convenience, Compose gives you:
- **Reproducibility** — everyone on the team runs the exact same environment
- **Documentation** — the compose file describes the entire stack
- **Consistency** — same config runs on dev laptop, CI server, and staging

## Docker Compose File Structure

A `docker-compose.yml` file has four top-level sections:

```yaml
version: "3.8"    # optional in modern Docker

services:          # define containers
  web:
    ...
  db:
    ...

volumes:           # define persistent storage
  db-data:

networks:          # define custom networks
  app-network:
```

**`version` field:** In modern Docker (Compose V2), this is optional — Docker automatically uses the latest format. You may still see it in existing projects. If you include it, `"3.8"` is a safe choice.

---

## Services — The Heart of Compose

Each key under `services:` defines a container. The key name becomes both the service name and the DNS hostname other services use to reach it.

```yaml
services:
  taskmanager:      # ← this is the hostname other services use
    ...
  mongodb:          # ← Flask connects to "mongodb:27017"
    ...
```

---

## Every Service Key Explained

### `image` — Use a Pre-built Image

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mongo:4.4          # pull from Docker Hub
  cache:
    image: redis:7-alpine
```

If the image isn't on your machine, Docker pulls it automatically.

### `build` — Build from Dockerfile

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .                  # Dockerfile in current directory

  # More explicit form
  api:
    build:
      context: .              # where to find files
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod   # custom Dockerfile name
      args:
        NODE_VERSION: 20      # build-time variables
```

Use `image:` when you're using an existing image unchanged. Use `build:` when you have a Dockerfile and need to build your own image.

### `container_name` — Custom Name

```yaml
services:
  web:
    container_name: my-web-server   # instead of project_web_1
```

Without this, Compose names containers as `<project>_<service>_<number>`.

### `ports` — Port Mapping

```yaml
services:
  web:
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"        # host:container
      - "8080:80"
      - "127.0.0.1:5000:5000"   # bind to specific host interface only
```

### `environment` — Environment Variables

Two formats, both equivalent:

```yaml
# List format
environment:
  - MONGO_URI=mongodb://admin:password@mongodb:27017/
  - DB_NAME=taskmanager
  - FLASK_ENV=production

# Dictionary format (cleaner for many variables)
environment:
  MONGO_URI: mongodb://admin:password@mongodb:27017/
  DB_NAME: taskmanager
  FLASK_ENV: production
```

### `env_file` — Load from File

```yaml
services:
  api:
    env_file:
      - .env              # loads all KEY=VALUE pairs from .env file
      - .env.production   # can load multiple files
```

This is the right pattern for secrets — keep them in `.env` (gitignored), reference the file in compose. Never hardcode secrets directly in `docker-compose.yml`.

### `volumes` — Storage

```yaml
services:
  db:
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db          # named volume
      - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d   # bind mount
      - /absolute/host/path:/container/path  # absolute bind mount
```

### `networks` — Which Networks to Join

```yaml
services:
  api:
    networks:
      - frontend-net
      - backend-net

  db:
    networks:
      - backend-net    # db is only on backend, not reachable from frontend
```

### `depends_on` — Startup Order

```yaml
services:
  api:
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    # api starts after db and redis containers START
    # (not necessarily after they're READY — see healthcheck for that)
```

**Important limitation:** `depends_on` only waits for the container to start, not for the service inside to be ready. MongoDB takes a few seconds to initialize after the container starts. For true readiness checking:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy   # wait for healthcheck to pass

  db:
    image: mongo:4.4
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongosh", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
```

### `restart` — Restart Policy

```yaml
restart: no            # never restart (default)
restart: always        # always restart (even on manual stop)
restart: on-failure    # restart only on non-zero exit code
restart: unless-stopped   # restart unless you manually stopped it
```

**Production recommendation:** `unless-stopped` — restarts on crash and server reboot, but respects manual stops.

### `healthcheck` — Container Health

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/health"]
  interval: 30s       # how often to check
  timeout: 10s        # how long to wait for response
  retries: 3          # failures before marking unhealthy
  start_period: 5s    # grace period before first check
```

---

## Top-Level Volumes and Networks

These declare resources that can be shared across services:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    volumes:
      - db-data:/data/db   # references top-level volume

  backup:
    volumes:
      - db-data:/backup    # same volume, different mount path

volumes:
  db-data:                 # Docker manages this
    external: false        # false = Docker creates it, true = must already exist

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16   # custom subnet
```

**Service-level vs top-level:**
- `volumes:` inside a service → mount points for that container
- `volumes:` at top level → declares the named volume
- Same relationship for `networks:`

## Complete Example — Taskmanager Stack

```yaml
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:4.4
    container_name: mongodb
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db
    networks:
      - taskmanager-net
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongosh", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
    restart: unless-stopped

  taskmanager:
    build: .
    container_name: taskmanager
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      MONGO_URI: mongodb://admin:password@mongodb:27017/
      DB_NAME: taskmanager
    depends_on:
      mongodb:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - taskmanager-net
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  mongodb_data:

networks:
  taskmanager-net:
    driver: bridge
```

## Essential Compose Commands

```bash
# Start all services (detached)
docker compose up -d

# Start and rebuild images first
docker compose up --build -d

# Start specific service only
docker compose up -d mongodb

# Stop and remove containers (volumes preserved)
docker compose down

# Stop and remove containers AND volumes (data deleted)
docker compose down -v

# Stop containers (keeps containers, doesn't remove)
docker compose stop

# Start stopped containers
docker compose start

# Restart all services
docker compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart taskmanager

# View logs
docker compose logs

# Follow logs in real time
docker compose logs -f

# Logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f taskmanager

# List containers in this compose project
docker compose ps

# Build images without starting
docker compose build

# Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# Scale a service (run multiple instances)
docker compose up -d --scale api=3

# Run a one-off command in a service container
docker compose run --rm api python manage.py migrate

# Execute command in running service container
docker compose exec taskmanager bash
```

---

## Running Multiple Compose Stacks on Same Host

If you need to run the same compose file multiple times on one server (e.g., multiple customer deployments), use project names:

```bash
# Default — project name is directory name
docker compose up -d

# Custom project name — creates separate containers, networks, volumes
docker compose -p customer-1 up -d
docker compose -p customer-2 up -d
```

Each project gets its own namespace: `customer-1_taskmanager_1`, `customer-2_taskmanager_1`. You'll also need different host port mappings to avoid conflicts.

## Docker Compose vs Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes

| | Docker Compose | Docker Swarm | Kubernetes |
|--|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Use case | Local dev, single host | Multi-host production | Multi-host, large scale |
| Complexity | Simple | Medium | Complex |
| Scaling | Manual (`--scale`) | Built-in | Built-in + auto-scaling |
| Self-healing | No | Yes | Yes |
| Rolling updates | No | Yes | Yes |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium | High |
| Best for | Development, simple deploys | Small production clusters | Production at scale |

**The progression:** you learn Docker Compose first because it's simple and teaches all the concepts (services, networks, volumes, environment). Swarm and Kubernetes use the same ideas but add multi-host distribution, scheduling, and automatic healing.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What is Docker Compose and when would you use it?"**
> "Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications using a single YAML file. Instead of running multiple `docker run` commands with all their flags and managing networks manually, I define all services, their configuration, networks, and volumes in `docker-compose.yml` and start everything with `docker compose up -d`. I use it for local development to replicate the production stack, and for simple single-host deployments. For production at scale with multiple hosts, I'd use Kubernetes."

**Q: "What does `depends_on` do and what doesn't it do?"**
> "`depends_on` controls startup order — the service waits for the listed services to start before it starts. But it only waits for the container to start, not for the application inside to be ready. MongoDB might take 5-10 seconds after the container starts before it's actually accepting connections. If my API starts immediately after MongoDB's container starts, it might fail trying to connect before MongoDB is ready. The proper solution is `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`, which waits for the container's healthcheck to pass — meaning the actual service is ready, not just the container."
