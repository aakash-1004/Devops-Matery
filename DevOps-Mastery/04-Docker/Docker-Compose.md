## What Is Docker Compose?

Running multiple containers with long `docker run` commands is messy. Docker Compose lets you define all containers in one YAML file and manage them together.

```bash
# Without Compose — two long commands, manual network setup
docker network create taskmanager-net
docker run -d --name mongodb --network taskmanager-net ...
docker run -d --name taskmanager --network taskmanager-net ...

# With Compose — one command
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Taskmanager docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:6
    container_name: mongodb
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db
    networks:
      - taskmanager-net

  taskmanager:
    build: .
    container_name: taskmanager
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      MONGO_URI: mongodb://admin:password@mongodb:27017/
      DB_NAME: taskmanager
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    networks:
      - taskmanager-net

volumes:
  mongodb_data:

networks:
  taskmanager-net:
    driver: bridge
```

## Breaking Down Each Field

**`services`** — defines each container

**`image: mongo:6`** — use this image from registry (don't build)

**`build: .`** — build image from Dockerfile in current directory

**`container_name`** — explicit name. Also used as hostname on the network

**`environment`** — inject env vars into the container

**`ports: "5000:5000"`** — map host:container port

**`volumes: mongodb_data:/data/db`** — mount named volume to container path. Persists data across restarts

**`depends_on: mongodb`** — start mongodb before taskmanager. Note: doesn't wait for MongoDB to be *ready*, just *started*

**`networks`** — puts containers on same network so they can communicate

**`volumes` (top level)** — declares named volumes. Docker manages storage location on host

---

## Volumes — Why They Matter

```yaml
volumes:
  - mongodb_data:/data/db
```

Without this — every `docker compose down` destroys all MongoDB data. Container filesystem is ephemeral.

With this — data lives in a Docker-managed volume on the host:
```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/taskmanager_mongodb_data/_data
```

Container is destroyed and recreated → data survives.

```bash
# Inspect volume
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect taskmanager_mongodb_data

# Remove volume (destroys data)
docker compose down -v    # -v flag removes volumes too
```

---

## Essential Compose Commands

```bash
docker compose up -d          # start all containers detached
docker compose up --build -d  # rebuild images then start
docker compose down           # stop and remove containers
docker compose down -v        # stop, remove containers + volumes
docker compose ps             # list containers in this compose project
docker compose logs           # view all logs
docker compose logs -f        # follow all logs
docker compose logs taskmanager  # logs for specific service
docker compose restart taskmanager  # restart one service
docker compose exec taskmanager bash  # shell into service
docker compose build          # rebuild images without starting
```

---

## `-d` Flag — Detached Mode

```bash
docker compose up -d    # background, terminal is free
docker compose up       # foreground, logs stream, Ctrl+C stops everything
```

Always use `-d` in production and during normal development. Drop `-d` only when actively debugging.

---

## Common Gotcha — depends_on

`depends_on` only waits for the container to **start**, not for the service inside to be **ready**. MongoDB takes a few seconds to initialize after the container starts.

In production, handle this with a health check or retry logic in your app. Flask's pymongo will retry connections automatically — so for dev this is fine.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What is Docker Compose and when would you use it?"**
> "Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. Instead of writing multiple `docker run` commands with long flags, you define all services, networks, and volumes in a single `docker-compose.yml` file. One `docker compose up -d` starts everything. I use it for local development and testing — in production, Kubernetes handles orchestration. The key benefit is reproducibility — anyone can clone the repo and run the full stack with one command."

**Q: "How do you persist data in Docker?"**
> "With volumes. Container filesystems are ephemeral — destroyed when the container is removed. Named volumes map a path inside the container to a Docker-managed directory on the host. For MongoDB I mount `mongodb_data:/data/db` — so when I run `docker compose down` and back up, all the data is still there. The volume lives at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on the host."
