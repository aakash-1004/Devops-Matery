## What Problem Docker Solves

Without Docker:
- App runs on your machine with your Python version, your libraries, your OS config
- "Works on my machine" → breaks on server
- Every new developer needs manual environment setup

With Docker:
- App runs inside a container — isolated environment with everything it needs
- Same container runs identically on any machine
- No manual setup — just `docker run`

---

## Core Concepts

**Image** — read-only blueprint/template. Defines what's inside the container. Like a class in OOP.

**Container** — a running instance of an image. Like an object created from a class. You can run 10 containers from the same image.

**Dockerfile** — instructions to build an image. Like a recipe.

**Registry** — storage for images. Docker Hub = public. AWS ECR = private (used at work).

```
Dockerfile → docker build → Image → docker run → Container
```

## How Images Work — Layers

Every Dockerfile instruction creates a layer:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim        # Layer 1 — base OS + Python
WORKDIR /app                 # Layer 2 — set working directory
COPY requirements.txt .      # Layer 3 — copy requirements
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # Layer 4 — install deps
COPY . .                     # Layer 5 — copy app code
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]    # Layer 6 — default command
```

**Layer caching:**
- Layers are cached — if a layer hasn't changed, Docker reuses it
- First build: 20 seconds. Rebuild with no changes: 1.3 seconds
- Change `app.py` → only Layer 5 rebuilds, Layers 1-4 stay cached

**Why order matters:**
- `COPY requirements.txt` before `COPY . .` — dependencies change less often than code
- If reversed, every code change triggers a slow `pip install`
- This is a common interview question

---

## Dockerfile — Taskmanager

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

**Each instruction:**
- `FROM` — base image. `slim` = minimal OS, smaller image
- `WORKDIR` — sets working directory inside container. Creates it if doesn't exist
- `COPY requirements.txt .` — copy only requirements first (caching optimization)
- `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir` — install deps. `--no-cache-dir` keeps image smaller
- `COPY . .` — copy rest of app code
- `EXPOSE 5000` — documents the port (doesn't actually publish it — `-p` does that)
- `CMD` — default command when container starts. Can be overridden at runtime

---

## .dockerignore

Excludes files from build context — keeps image small and prevents secrets leaking:

```
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.git/
.env
*.md
```

Without `.dockerignore`, Docker copies everything including `venv/` and `.git/` — unnecessary bloat and potential security risk if `.env` contains secrets.

---

## Docker Networking

Containers are isolated by default — can't talk to each other unless on the same network.

```bash
# Create a network
docker network create taskmanager-net

# Connect existing container to network
docker network connect taskmanager-net mongodb

# Run new container on network
docker run -d --network taskmanager-net --name taskmanager taskmanager:v1
```

**Key concept:** On a Docker network, containers talk to each other using **container names as hostnames**.

```python
# Instead of localhost:27017
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://admin:password@mongodb:27017/"
#                                       ^ container name
```

This is why env vars for config matter — the hostname changes between local, Docker, and K8s.

## Essential Docker Commands

```bash
# Images
docker images                          # list local images
docker pull nginx                      # download from registry
docker build -t myapp:v1 .             # build from Dockerfile
docker rmi myapp:v1                    # remove image

# Containers
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name app taskmanager:v1
docker ps                              # running containers
docker ps -a                           # all containers including stopped
docker stop app                        # stop container
docker rm app                          # remove container
docker logs app                        # view logs
docker logs -f app                     # follow logs (like tail -f)
docker exec -it app bash               # shell inside container

# Networking
docker network ls
docker network create mynet
docker network connect mynet container1

# Cleanup
docker system prune                    # remove stopped containers + unused images
docker volume ls                       # list volumes
```

---

## Port Mapping — `-p host:container`

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 taskmanager:v1
#               host:container
```

- `5000:5000` → requests to host port 5000 are forwarded to container port 5000
- `-p 8080:5000` → host port 8080 maps to container port 5000
- Without `-p`, container port is not accessible from outside

---

## Multi-Stage Builds

Separates build environment from runtime — reduces final image size:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 — Builder
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --prefix=/install -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2 — Runtime
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

Critical for compiled languages (Go, Java) where builder image is 1GB but runtime is 20MB.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What's the difference between an image and a container?"**
> "An image is a read-only blueprint — it defines the OS, dependencies, and app code. A container is a running instance of that image. The relationship is like a class and an object — one image can spawn multiple containers. Images are built once and shared via registries like Docker Hub or AWS ECR. Containers are ephemeral — they start, run, and stop."

**Q: "Why does layer order matter in a Dockerfile?"**
> "Docker caches layers. If a layer hasn't changed, it reuses the cached version. So I put `COPY requirements.txt` and `RUN pip install` before `COPY . .` — because dependencies change less often than code. If I put `COPY . .` first, every single code change would invalidate the pip install cache and trigger a slow reinstall. Correct ordering makes rebuilds go from 20 seconds to under 2 seconds."

**Q: "How do containers communicate with each other?"**
> "By putting them on the same Docker network. Once on the same network, containers can reach each other using their container names as hostnames. So my Flask container connects to MongoDB using `mongodb:27017` — `mongodb` being the container name, not localhost. This is why I use environment variables for connection strings — the hostname changes between local development, Docker, and Kubernetes."
