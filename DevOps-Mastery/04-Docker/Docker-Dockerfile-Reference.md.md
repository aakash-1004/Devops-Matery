## What Is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a plain text file containing a sequence of instructions that tell Docker how to build an image. Think of it as a recipe: Docker reads it top to bottom, executes each instruction, and produces a finished image.

Each instruction creates a new **layer** — a read-only snapshot of the changes made. All layers stack together to form the final image. This layered approach enables caching, sharing, and incremental builds.

**Key principle:** instruction order matters enormously. Instructions that change infrequently (installing dependencies) should come before instructions that change often (copying source code). This maximizes cache hits and minimizes rebuild time.

---

## Build Context — What Docker Can See

When you run `docker build -t myapp .`, the `.` tells Docker where to find the build context — the set of files it has access to during the build.

Docker sends the entire build context to the daemon before building. If your project directory has 500MB of files and you only need 10MB for the build, Docker still sends all 500MB. This is why `.dockerignore` exists — it's like `.gitignore` but for Docker builds.

```
# .dockerignore
venv/
node_modules/
.git/
*.md
.env
__pycache__/
```

## Dockerfile Instructions — Complete Reference

### FROM — Base Image

Every Dockerfile must start with FROM. It specifies the base image — the starting point your image is built on.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
FROM ubuntu:24.04
FROM node:20-alpine
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
FROM scratch          # empty base — for fully static binaries
```

**Tag choices matter:**
- `python:3.12` — full image with many tools (larger)
- `python:3.12-slim` — minimal Debian, no extras (~150MB)
- `python:3.12-alpine` — Alpine Linux base (~50MB but may have compatibility issues)

**Best practice:** always pin a specific version tag. Never use `latest` in production — it changes and breaks builds silently.

---

### WORKDIR — Working Directory

Sets the working directory inside the image for all subsequent instructions. Created automatically if it doesn't exist.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

All following `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT` instructions execute relative to this directory. Without `WORKDIR`, everything happens in `/` (root) which is messy and dangerous.

---

### COPY — Copy Files

Copies files from the build context (your host machine) into the image filesystem.

```dockerfile
COPY <source-on-host> <destination-in-image>

COPY requirements.txt .           # copy to WORKDIR
COPY . .                          # copy everything to WORKDIR
COPY src/ /app/src/               # copy directory
COPY config.json /etc/myapp/      # copy to specific path
```

**Layer caching optimization — critical pattern:**
```dockerfile
# WRONG — bad cache behavior
COPY . .                          # copies everything first
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt   # runs every time ANY file changes

# CORRECT — good cache behavior
COPY requirements.txt .           # only copy requirements first
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt   # cached unless requirements.txt changes
COPY . .                          # copy rest of code
```

The wrong approach means every change to `app.py` triggers a full `pip install`. The correct approach means pip install only runs when `requirements.txt` actually changes.

---

### ADD — Extended Copy

Like `COPY` but with two extra abilities:
1. Automatically extracts `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.bz2` archives
2. Can download files from URLs

```dockerfile
ADD app.tar.gz /app/              # auto-extracted
ADD https://example.com/file.txt /app/   # downloaded
```

**Best practice:** use `COPY` for everything except when you specifically need auto-extraction or URL download. `COPY` is more explicit and predictable.

---

### RUN — Execute Commands During Build

Executes commands during the **image build process**. Creates a new layer with the results.

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl wget
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN npm install
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

**Chain commands to reduce layers:**
```dockerfile
# BAD — 3 layers, each wasting space
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get clean

# GOOD — 1 layer, cleanup happens in same layer
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Each `RUN` creates a layer. If you install packages in one RUN and delete them in another, the deleted files are still in the previous layer — the image doesn't get smaller. Cleanup must happen in the same `RUN` instruction.

---

### ENV — Environment Variables

Sets environment variables that persist into the running container.

```dockerfile
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV APP_PORT=5000
ENV DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5432   # multiple on one line
```

These are available both during build (in subsequent RUN instructions) and at runtime inside the container. Override at runtime with `docker run -e NODE_ENV=development`.

---

### EXPOSE — Document Port

Declares which port the application listens on inside the container.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 5000
EXPOSE 80 443
EXPOSE 8080/udp
```

**Important:** `EXPOSE` is documentation only. It does NOT publish the port to the host. You still need `-p` when running the container. Think of it as metadata that tells other developers (and tools) which port the app uses.

---

### USER — Set Running User

Sets which user runs subsequent commands. By default Docker uses root — a security risk.

```dockerfile
# Create a non-root user
RUN useradd -m -u 1001 appuser

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# All following commands run as appuser
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

**Why this matters:** if someone exploits a vulnerability in your app, they'd have root access inside the container if you're running as root. Running as a non-root user limits the blast radius. This is a security best practice for production images.

---

### CMD — Default Command

Defines the **default command** that runs when the container starts. Can be overridden when running `docker run`.

```dockerfile
# Exec form (recommended)
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

# Shell form (runs in /bin/sh -c)
CMD python3 app.py
```

```bash
docker run myimage              # runs: python3 app.py (CMD)
docker run myimage bash         # runs: bash (CMD replaced)
docker run myimage python3 test.py  # runs: python3 test.py (CMD replaced)
```

**Use CMD when:** you want a sensible default but allow the user to easily run something different.

---

### ENTRYPOINT — Fixed Executable

Defines the main executable that always runs. Unlike CMD, it's not easily overridden. Arguments passed to `docker run` are appended to the ENTRYPOINT.

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
```

```bash
docker run myimage app.py        # runs: python3 app.py
docker run myimage test.py       # runs: python3 test.py
docker run myimage --version     # runs: python3 --version
```

**Use ENTRYPOINT when:** the container should always behave like a specific application — like a CLI tool.

---

### CMD + ENTRYPOINT Together — Best Practice

The most powerful pattern is combining both:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]    # always runs python3
CMD ["app.py"]             # default argument — run app.py
```

```bash
docker run myimage              # python3 app.py
docker run myimage test.py      # python3 test.py (CMD replaced, ENTRYPOINT fixed)
```

ENTRYPOINT = the fixed command. CMD = default arguments. Override CMD to change what the command does, ENTRYPOINT stays the same.

**Interview answer:** "CMD provides default commands or arguments that can be overridden when launching the container. ENTRYPOINT defines a fixed executable making the container behave like a specific application. Together, ENTRYPOINT is the fixed command and CMD is the default argument — you can override CMD to pass different arguments while keeping the same executable."

---

### HEALTHCHECK — Container Health

Defines a command Docker runs periodically to check if the container is healthy. Docker tracks the health status: starting → healthy/unhealthy.

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/health || exit 1
```

```bash
# Check health status
docker ps        # shows health status in STATUS column
docker inspect <container> | grep Health
```

**Why it matters:** Kubernetes and Docker Compose use health checks to decide when a container is ready to receive traffic and whether to restart unhealthy containers.

---

### LABEL — Metadata

Adds key-value metadata to the image. Useful for documentation, tooling, and filtering.

```dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="aakash@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="Task Manager API"
```

---

### ARG — Build-Time Variables

Like `ENV` but only available during the build process, not in the running container.

```dockerfile
ARG NODE_VERSION=20
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine

ARG BUILD_DATE
LABEL build-date=${BUILD_DATE}
```

```bash
docker build --build-arg NODE_VERSION=18 .
```

Use `ARG` for build-time configuration (which base image version to use, build metadata). Use `ENV` for runtime configuration.

---

## Complete Dockerfile Example — Python Flask App

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Metadata
LABEL maintainer="aakash@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies first (rarely changes — cached)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies (changes only when requirements.txt changes)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code (changes frequently)
COPY . .

# Create non-root user for security
RUN useradd -m -u 1001 appuser
USER appuser

# Document the port
EXPOSE 5000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/health || exit 1

# Default command
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

## Multi-Stage Build — Java Example

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 — Build
FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml first — download deps (cached unless pom.xml changes)
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Copy source and build
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests
# Output: /app/target/app.jar

# Stage 2 — Runtime only (no Maven, no source code)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the JAR from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

**Result:** Final image is ~200MB instead of 1GB+ because it contains only the JRE and JAR — no Maven, no source code, no build tools.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What's the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?"**
> "CMD sets the default command that runs when the container starts, but it's easily overridden — if you pass a command to `docker run`, it replaces CMD entirely. ENTRYPOINT sets the fixed executable that always runs — arguments passed to `docker run` are appended to it rather than replacing it. The best pattern is using both together: ENTRYPOINT as the fixed executable and CMD as the default arguments. This way `docker run myimage` runs the defaults, but `docker run myimage --flag` passes the flag to the ENTRYPOINT."

**Q: "Why do we separate `COPY requirements.txt` from `COPY . .`?"**
> "Docker caches layers. If I put `COPY . .` first and then `RUN pip install`, every single code change — even a one-line fix — invalidates the layer cache and triggers a full pip install that might take 2-3 minutes. By copying requirements.txt first and running pip install before copying the rest of the code, the pip install layer is only re-executed when requirements.txt actually changes. Code changes only rebuild the final COPY layer, taking seconds instead of minutes."
