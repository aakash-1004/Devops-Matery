## Images vs Containers — The Mental Model

The relationship between images and containers is like the relationship between a **class and an object** in programming, or a **recipe and a meal**.

- **Image** = the blueprint. Read-only. Doesn't run. Just defines what the container will look like.
- **Container** = a running instance of an image. Has its own writable layer, network, processes.

You can create 10 containers from the same image simultaneously. Each is completely isolated from the others — different filesystem state, different processes, different network connections. But they all share the same underlying read-only image layers.

```
nginx:latest (image)
    ├── container-web-1  (running, port 8080)
    ├── container-web-2  (running, port 8081)
    └── container-web-3  (stopped)
```

## Docker Login

Before pushing or pulling from private registries, you need to authenticate.

```bash
# Method 1 — interactive (prompts for username and password)
docker login

# Method 2 — inline credentials
docker login -u <username> -p <password>

# Method 3 — using access token (recommended — more secure than password)
docker login -u <username> -p <access-token>

# Logout
docker logout
```

**Why use access tokens instead of passwords?**
Access tokens can be scoped (read-only vs read-write), can be rotated without changing your password, and can be revoked individually if compromised. Docker Hub, AWS ECR, and GitHub Container Registry all use tokens.

## Image Management

### List, Build, Tag, Remove

```bash
# List all local images
docker images

# Build image from Dockerfile in current directory
docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .

# Build with specific Dockerfile path
docker build -t my-app:v1 -f Dockerfile.prod .

# Tag an existing image with a new name
docker tag <existing-image> <new-name>:<tag>
# Example: docker tag my-app:latest aakash0908/my-app:v2

# Remove a specific image
docker rmi <image-id or image-name>

# Remove all dangling images (untagged <none> images)
docker image prune

# Remove ALL unused images (dangling + unused tagged)
docker image prune -a

# Remove all images (nuclear option)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)

# Inspect detailed image metadata
docker inspect <image-id or name>
```

### Dangling Images — What They Are

A dangling image is an image with no name and no tag — shows as `<none>` in `docker images`. They're created when you rebuild an image with the same tag — the old layers become orphaned and show as `<none>`.

```bash
# See dangling images
docker images -f dangling=true

	# Remove dangling only (safe — doesn't touch tagged images)
docker image prune

# Remove all unused including tagged (more aggressive)
docker image prune -a
```

**Interview one-liner:** "`docker image prune` removes only dangling images — untagged leftover layers. `docker image prune -a` removes all images not currently used by any container, including tagged ones."

## Container Lifecycle

A container goes through several states during its life:

```
docker create → CREATED
docker start  → RUNNING
docker pause  → PAUSED
docker stop   → EXITED (graceful)
docker kill   → EXITED (forced)
docker rm     → REMOVED (gone)
```

### Container States

| State | Meaning | How to reach it |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Created | Built but not started | `docker create` |
| Running | Actively executing | `docker start` or `docker run` |
| Paused | Temporarily frozen | `docker pause` |
| Restarting | In restart cycle | `docker restart` |
| Exited | Stopped | `docker stop` |
| Dead | Broken/unusable | System/OOM error |
| Removing | Being deleted | `docker rm` |

---

## Running Containers — `docker run`

`docker run` is the most important Docker command. It creates AND starts a container in one step.

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND]
```

### Key Options

```bash
# Run in background (detached) — most common for servers
docker run -d nginx

# Map host port to container port
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
# 8080 = host port (what you access from outside)
# 80   = container port (where app listens inside)

# Set environment variable
docker run -e DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=5432 my-app

# Give container a name (otherwise Docker assigns a random name)
docker run --name my-webserver nginx

# Run interactively with terminal (useful for debugging)
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# Run and auto-remove when stopped
docker run --rm ubuntu echo "hello"

# Combine options (typical production command)
docker run -d \
  --name taskmanager \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/" \
  --network my-network \
  taskmanager:v1
```

### `-d` vs `-it` — When to Use Each

`-d` (detached) runs the container in the background. Your terminal is free. Use this for servers, databases, long-running services — anything that should keep running.

`-it` (interactive + TTY) attaches your terminal to the container's stdin/stdout. Use this for one-off commands, debugging, or when you need to interact with a shell inside the container.

---

## Accessing Running Containers

### `docker exec` — The Safe Way

Opens a new shell session inside a running container. This is what you use 99% of the time.

```bash
# Open bash shell inside container
docker exec -it <container-name> bash

# If bash not available (Alpine images), use sh
docker exec -it <container-name> sh

# Run a single command without interactive shell
docker exec <container-name> cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Run as specific user
docker exec -u root -it <container-name> bash
```

**Why `exec` is safe:** it opens a new separate process inside the container. When you exit, you're just closing that process. The main container process (PID 1) keeps running.

### `docker attach` — The Risky Way

Connects your terminal directly to the container's main process (PID 1).

```bash
docker attach <container-name>
```

**The risk:** if you press `Ctrl+C`, you send SIGINT to the main process — which may stop the container entirely.

**Safe exit from attach:** `Ctrl + P + Q` — detaches your terminal without stopping the container.

**Best practice:** always use `exec` for debugging. Only use `attach` if you specifically need to see the main process output and understand the risks.

## Container Management Commands

```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# List ALL containers (running + stopped)
docker ps -a

# Start a stopped container
docker start <container-name>

# Stop a running container (graceful — sends SIGTERM, waits 10s, then SIGKILL)
docker stop <container-name>

# Restart a container
docker restart <container-name>

# Kill a container immediately (sends SIGKILL — no graceful shutdown)
docker kill <container-name>

# Remove a stopped container
docker rm <container-name>

# Force remove a running container (stop + remove in one step)
docker rm -f <container-name>

# Remove all stopped containers
docker container prune
```

### `stop` vs `kill` — Important Difference

`docker stop` sends **SIGTERM** to the process — asking it to shut down gracefully. The app can catch this signal and clean up (close database connections, finish in-flight requests). After 10 seconds if still running, Docker sends **SIGKILL**.

`docker kill` sends **SIGKILL** immediately — no grace period, no cleanup. The process is terminated instantly.

**Always use `stop` in production.** Use `kill` only if `stop` isn't working.

## Container Inspection and Logs

```bash
# View container logs
docker logs <container-name>

# Follow logs in real time (like tail -f)
docker logs -f <container-name>

# Last 100 lines
docker logs --tail 100 <container-name>

# Logs with timestamps
docker logs -t <container-name>

# Show running processes inside container
docker top <container-name>

# Get detailed JSON metadata about a container
docker inspect <container-name>
# Contains: IP address, env vars, volumes, network config, restart count, etc.

# Live resource usage (CPU, memory, network I/O)
docker stats

# Specific container stats
docker stats <container-name>
```

### `docker inspect` — What You Can Extract

```bash
# Get just the IP address
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}'

# Get environment variables
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.Config.Env}}'

# Get mounted volumes
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.Mounts}}'
```

---

## Copying Files Between Host and Container

`docker cp` copies files between your host machine and a container without needing to exec inside it.

```bash
# Copy FROM container TO host
docker cp <container>:<container-path> <host-path>
# Example: copy app logs to your current directory
docker cp my-container:/app/logs.txt ./logs.txt

# Copy FROM host TO container
docker cp <host-path> <container>:<container-path>
# Example: copy a config file into a running container
docker cp config.json my-container:/app/config.json
```

**When is this useful?**
- Extracting log files from a container for debugging
- Pushing a hotfix config file into a running container without rebuilding
- Getting build artifacts out of a build container

---

## Cleanup Commands

Docker accumulates a lot of disk usage over time — old images, stopped containers, unused volumes. Regular cleanup is important on development machines.

```bash
# Remove all stopped containers
docker container prune

# Remove dangling images
docker image prune

# Remove all unused images
docker image prune -a

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune

# Remove unused networks
docker network prune

# Remove EVERYTHING unused at once (containers + images + networks + build cache)
docker system prune

# Include volumes in the nuclear cleanup
docker system prune --volumes

# Check disk usage
docker system df
```

**Warning:** `docker system prune` is aggressive on a development machine. It removes everything not currently attached to a running container — including images you might want to keep.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What's the difference between `docker stop` and `docker kill`?"**
> "`docker stop` sends SIGTERM to the container's main process, giving it time to shut down gracefully — close database connections, finish in-flight requests, write final logs. After a 10-second timeout it sends SIGKILL. `docker kill` sends SIGKILL immediately with no grace period. In production you always use `stop` to avoid data corruption or dropped connections. `kill` is a last resort when the process is hung and not responding to SIGTERM."

**Q: "What's the difference between `docker exec` and `docker attach`?"**
> "`exec` opens a new process inside the container — exiting that process doesn't affect the container. `attach` connects your terminal to the main process (PID 1) — if you send SIGINT with Ctrl+C, it might kill the container. For debugging I always use `exec -it container bash`. The safe exit from attach is Ctrl+P+Q which detaches without stopping the container."
