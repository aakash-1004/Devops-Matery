## Core Concepts

### Q1: What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform used to package applications with all their dependencies into isolated environments called containers. It solves the "works on my machine" problem by ensuring the application runs identically across development, staging, and production environments.

---

### Q2: What are the key components of Docker?

- **Docker Engine** — the complete Docker platform (CLI + REST API + Daemon)
- **Docker Daemon (dockerd)** — background service that manages containers, images, volumes, networks
- **Dockerfile** — text file with instructions to build an image
- **Docker Image** — read-only template/blueprint for creating containers
- **Docker Container** — running instance of an image
- **Docker Registry** — storage for images (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.)
- **Docker Volumes** — persistent storage outside container lifecycle
- **Docker Networking** — virtual networks enabling container communication

**Engine vs Daemon:** Docker Engine is the full platform (like the whole car). Docker Daemon is just the background service (the engine inside the car). The Daemon actually creates and manages containers; the CLI sends it instructions via REST API.

---

### Q3: How is a Docker container different from a Virtual Machine?

**Virtual Machine:**
- Hardware-level virtualization via Hypervisor
- Each VM has its own full Guest OS
- Heavy — GBs of RAM just for OS overhead
- Slow to start — minutes
- Strong isolation at hardware level

**Docker Container:**
- OS-level virtualization using Linux namespaces + cgroups
- Shares the host OS kernel — no duplicate OS
- Lightweight — MBs
- Fast — milliseconds to start
- Good isolation at process level

**When to use VMs:** when you need strong hardware-level isolation, running different OS types, or legacy systems that require full OS environments.

**When to use containers:** application deployment, microservices, CI/CD, anything where speed and resource efficiency matter.

---

### Q4: What is a Docker image layer and why does it matter?

Every instruction in a Dockerfile creates a read-only layer — a snapshot of filesystem changes at that point. Layers stack to form the complete image.

**Why it matters:**

1. **Caching** — unchanged layers are reused. If you change `app.py` but not `requirements.txt`, Docker skips the pip install layer (which might take 2 minutes) and only rebuilds the copy layer (seconds).

2. **Sharing** — if 20 images use the same base image, that base layer is stored once on disk. Saves significant storage.

3. **Fast pulls** — when pulling a new image version, only changed layers download.

**Best practice implication:** put frequently-changing instructions (COPY app code) AFTER infrequently-changing ones (RUN pip install) to maximize cache hits.

---

### Q5: What is Docker Hub?

Docker Hub is the default public cloud-based Docker registry. It's where Docker looks when you run `docker pull nginx` — it downloads from Docker Hub. You can push your own images there (public or private). Companies also use private registries like AWS ECR, Google GCR, or GitHub Container Registry for proprietary images.

---

## Images and Containers

### Q6: What's the difference between `docker stop` and `docker kill`?

`docker stop` sends **SIGTERM** to the main process, giving it a grace period (default 10 seconds) to shut down gracefully — close DB connections, finish in-flight requests, flush logs. After the timeout, it sends SIGKILL.

`docker kill` sends **SIGKILL** immediately — no grace period, no cleanup. Process terminates instantly.

**Always use `stop` in production.** Use `kill` only when the process is hung and not responding to SIGTERM.

---

### Q7: What's the difference between `docker exec` and `docker attach`?

`docker exec -it container bash` opens a **new process** inside the container. Exiting it has no effect on the container — the main process (PID 1) keeps running.

`docker attach container` connects your terminal to the **main process (PID 1)**. Pressing Ctrl+C sends SIGINT to PID 1, which may stop the container.

**Safe exit from attach:** `Ctrl + P + Q` — disconnects without stopping the container.

**Best practice:** always use `exec` for debugging. Use `attach` only if you specifically need to interact with the main process output.

---

### Q8: What are the various states a Docker container can be in?

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Created | Built but not started |
| Running | Actively executing |
| Paused | Temporarily frozen |
| Restarting | In restart cycle |
| Exited | Stopped (clean or crashed) |
| Dead | Broken/unusable (OOM or system error) |
| Removing | Being deleted |

---

### Q9: What is a dangling image?

A dangling image is an image with no name and no tag — shows as `<none>:<none>` in `docker images`. Created when you rebuild an image with the same tag — the old layers become orphaned.

```bash
docker image prune      # removes only dangling images
docker image prune -a   # removes all unused images including tagged ones
```

**Interview one-liner:** "`docker image prune` removes only dangling (untagged) images. `docker image prune -a` removes all images not used by any running or stopped container."

---

## Networking

### Q10: What are Docker networks and why are they important?

Docker networks are virtual networks that control how containers communicate — with each other, with the host, and with the outside world. Without networks, isolated containers can't talk to each other even on the same machine.

**Key network types:**

| Type | Use case |
|------|---------|
| Bridge (default) | IP-only communication, no DNS |
| Bridge (custom) | Recommended — DNS by container name works |
| Host | Container uses host network directly |
| None | Complete isolation |
| Overlay | Multi-host (Docker Swarm/Kubernetes) |
| Macvlan | Container needs real network IP |

---

### Q11: What's the difference between default bridge and custom bridge?

**Default bridge (`docker0`):**
- Containers can only communicate by IP address
- No DNS — container names don't resolve to IPs
- IP addresses can change on restart
- All containers on default bridge can see each other (security concern)

**Custom bridge:**
- Docker's internal DNS resolves container names automatically
- `ping app1` works — no need to know the IP
- Isolated from other custom networks
- Always use custom networks for real applications

---

### Q12: What is the difference between EXPOSE and port mapping (-p)?

`EXPOSE` in a Dockerfile is documentation only — it declares which port the app listens on but does NOT make it accessible from outside. Think of it as metadata.

`-p host_port:container_port` in `docker run` actually publishes the port — creates a mapping so external traffic on the host port reaches the container port.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 5000     # tells others the app uses port 5000
```

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp   # actually makes port 5000 accessible
```

---

## Storage

### Q13: What's the difference between Docker volumes and bind mounts?

| | Named Volume | Bind Mount |
|--|-------------|-----------|
| Managed by | Docker | You |
| Location | `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` | Any host path |
| Portability | High | Low (path must exist) |
| Best for | Production databases, stateful data | Local development, source code |
| Security | More isolated | Host filesystem exposed |

**Named volume:** `docker run -v myvolume:/data/db` — Docker manages the storage location.

**Bind mount:** `docker run -v /home/aakash/code:/app` — direct host directory mapping.

**Practical rule:** use named volumes for production data, bind mounts for development (so code changes reflect immediately without rebuilding).

---

### Q14: When is data lost in Docker?

- **Without volume:** data is lost when the container is removed (`docker rm`)
- **With named volume:** data is lost only when the volume is explicitly deleted (`docker volume rm`)
- **With bind mount:** data is lost only if you delete the host directory or the disk fails
- **`docker compose down`:** containers removed, volumes preserved
- **`docker compose down -v`:** containers AND volumes removed — all data gone

---

## Dockerfile

### Q15: What's the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

**CMD:** default command that runs when container starts. Completely replaced if you pass a command to `docker run`.

**ENTRYPOINT:** fixed executable that always runs. Arguments from `docker run` are appended, not replacing it.

**Together (best practice):**
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]   # always run python3
CMD ["app.py"]           # default argument
```
- `docker run myimage` → `python3 app.py`
- `docker run myimage test.py` → `python3 test.py`

**Interview answer:** "CMD provides default commands or arguments that are overridden when launching the container. ENTRYPOINT defines a fixed executable making the container behave like a specific application. Together, ENTRYPOINT is the fixed command and CMD is the default argument."

---

### Q16: What is a multi-stage Docker build and why use it?

Multi-stage builds use multiple `FROM` instructions in one Dockerfile, allowing you to use a heavy build image and then copy only the final artifact into a minimal runtime image.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 — build (heavy image)
FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-17 AS builder
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package

# Stage 2 — runtime (minimal image)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

**Result:** Final image contains only the JRE + JAR. No Maven, no source code, no build tools. Reduces a 1GB+ image to ~200MB.

**Benefits:**
- Smaller image = faster pulls, less storage, smaller attack surface
- Build tools don't end up in production
- Clean separation between build and runtime environments

---

### Q17: What is the purpose of the WORKDIR instruction?

`WORKDIR` sets the current working directory inside the image for all subsequent instructions (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`). It's created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Without it, commands run in `/` (root) — messy and potentially dangerous. `WORKDIR /app` keeps everything in a clean, predictable directory.

---

## Docker Compose

### Q18: What is Docker Compose and how is it useful?

Docker Compose manages multi-container applications using a single `docker-compose.yml` file. Instead of multiple `docker run` commands, one `docker compose up -d` starts the entire stack.

**Key benefits:**
- Single command to start/stop everything
- Automatic networking between services (containers reach each other by service name)
- Reproducible environment — same for every developer
- Easy to manage volumes, environment variables, restart policies
- `docker compose down` cleanly stops and removes everything

---

### Q19: What does `depends_on` do — and what doesn't it do?

`depends_on` controls container start order — listed services start before the dependent one. **But it only waits for the container to start, not for the service inside to be ready.**

MongoDB takes ~5-10 seconds to initialize after its container starts. If your API starts immediately after the MongoDB container starts, the connection attempt may fail.

**Proper solution:** combine with healthcheck:
```yaml
depends_on:
  db:
    condition: service_healthy
```

This waits for MongoDB's healthcheck to pass — meaning it's actually accepting connections.

---

### Q20: How do you run multiple copies of a Compose file on the same host?

Use project names to namespace the deployment:
```bash
docker compose -p app1 up -d
docker compose -p app2 up -d
```

Each project gets isolated containers, networks, and volumes (`app1_web_1`, `app2_web_1`). You'll also need different host port mappings in each compose file to avoid port conflicts.

---

### Q21: How do you share a Docker image with others?

**Method 1 — Docker Hub:**
```bash
docker login
docker tag myapp:latest aakash0908/myapp:latest
docker push aakash0908/myapp:latest
# Others pull with:
docker pull aakash0908/myapp:latest
```

**Method 2 — AWS ECR:**
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
docker tag myapp:latest <ecr-uri>/myapp:latest
docker push <ecr-uri>/myapp:latest
```

**Method 3 — Save/Load (air-gapped environments):**
```bash
docker save myapp:latest | gzip > myapp.tar.gz
# Transfer file, then on other machine:
docker load < myapp.tar.gz
```

---

## Debugging

### Q22: How do you debug a running Docker container?

Systematic approach:

```bash
# 1. Check if container is running
docker ps

# 2. Check logs (most useful first step)
docker logs <container>
docker logs -f <container>       # follow in real time

# 3. Open shell inside container
docker exec -it <container> bash
# Inside: check files, run commands, test connections

# 4. Inspect configuration
docker inspect <container>
# Shows: env vars, network config, volumes, restart count

# 5. Check resource usage
docker stats <container>         # CPU, memory, network I/O

# 6. Check running processes inside container
docker top <container>

# 7. Test network connectivity from inside container
docker exec <container> curl http://localhost:5000/health
docker exec <container> ping google.com
```

---

### Q23: What are Docker namespaces?

Namespaces are a Linux kernel feature that Docker uses to provide container isolation. Each namespace gives a container its own isolated view of a system resource:

| Namespace | What It Isolates |
|-----------|-----------------|
| PID | Process IDs — container has its own PID 1 |
| Network | Network interfaces, IP addresses, routing |
| Mount | Filesystem mounts |
| UTS | Hostname |
| IPC | Inter-process communication |
| User | User and group IDs |

This is why `ps aux` inside a container shows only the container's processes, not the host's — PID namespace isolation.

---

### Q24: How do you secure Docker containers?

- **Run as non-root user** — add `USER appuser` in Dockerfile after creating the user
- **Read-only filesystem** — `docker run --read-only` where possible
- **Drop capabilities** — `docker run --cap-drop ALL --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE`
- **Limit resources** — `docker run --memory=512m --cpus=1.0`
- **Use trusted base images** — official images from Docker Hub, pin specific versions
- **Scan images for vulnerabilities** — `docker scout`, Trivy, Snyk
- **Never store secrets in images** — use environment variables or Docker secrets
- **Network isolation** — put services on separate networks, only expose what's needed
- **Keep images minimal** — smaller attack surface means fewer vulnerabilities
- **Enable Docker Content Trust** — `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` ensures signed images
