## Why Docker Networking Exists

When you run a container, it's isolated — it has its own network namespace (its own IP, its own interfaces, its own routing table). This is good for security and isolation, but it creates a problem: how do containers talk to each other?

Imagine you're running a Flask app in one container and MongoDB in another. The Flask app needs to connect to MongoDB at some address. But since each container has its own network namespace, `localhost` inside the Flask container refers to the Flask container itself — not the MongoDB container.

Docker networking solves this by creating virtual networks that containers can join. Containers on the same network can communicate with each other using either their IP addresses or — more usefully — their container names as hostnames.

This is exactly why your taskmanager Flask app uses `MONGO_URI = "mongodb://mongodb:27017/"` — `mongodb` is the container name, resolved as a hostname by Docker's internal DNS.

---

## How Port Mapping Works

Before diving into network types, understand port mapping — it's the most common networking concept you'll use daily.

Containers run in their own network namespace with their own ports. Port 5000 inside a container is not the same as port 5000 on your host machine. By default, container ports are not accessible from outside.

`-p host_port:container_port` creates a mapping:

```
External traffic → Host port 5000 → Container port 5000
```

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
# host port 5000 maps to container port 5000

docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
# host port 8080 maps to container port 80
# access via: http://localhost:8080
```

`EXPOSE` in a Dockerfile is documentation only — it declares which port the app uses inside the container but does NOT publish it to the host. You still need `-p` when running.

## Docker Network Types

Docker ships with several network drivers, each with different use cases:

| Network Type | Use Case | DNS by Name? |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| bridge (default) | Containers on same host, basic use | ❌ No |
| bridge (custom) | Containers on same host, recommended | ✅ Yes |
| host | Max performance, no isolation | N/A |
| none | Complete network isolation | N/A |
| overlay | Multi-host (Docker Swarm/K8s) | ✅ Yes |
| macvlan | Container needs real network IP | ✅ Yes |
| ipvlan | Like macvlan but shared MAC | ✅ Yes |

## Bridge Network — The Default

### What Is It?

Bridge is the default Docker network. When you run a container without specifying `--network`, it automatically joins the default bridge network called `docker0`.

Docker creates a virtual network interface (`docker0`) on the host, and each container gets connected to it via a `veth` pair (virtual ethernet — like a virtual cable with two ends, one in the container, one in the bridge).

```
Container 1 (172.17.0.2) ─── veth ─┐
                                    ├─── docker0 bridge ─── Host ─── Internet
Container 2 (172.17.0.3) ─── veth ─┘
```

### Default Bridge — The Problem

The default bridge (`docker0`) has a critical limitation: **containers can only reach each other by IP address, not by name.** Docker's internal DNS doesn't work on the default bridge.

```bash
# Both on default bridge
docker run -dit --name app1 ubuntu
docker run -dit --name app2 ubuntu

docker exec -it app2 bash

# Inside app2:
ping app1         # ❌ FAILS — name not resolved
ping 172.17.0.2   # ✅ WORKS — IP works
```

This is fragile in practice — container IPs can change every time you restart.

### Custom Bridge — The Right Way

Create your own bridge network and all the problems go away. Docker's internal DNS automatically resolves container names to IPs on custom networks.

```bash
# Create custom network
docker network create mynet

# Run containers on this network
docker run -dit --name app1 --network mynet ubuntu
docker run -dit --name app2 --network mynet ubuntu

docker exec -it app2 bash

# Inside app2:
ping app1         # ✅ WORKS — DNS resolves container name
ping 172.18.0.2   # ✅ Also works
```

**This is why your taskmanager Docker Compose worked** — Compose automatically creates a custom bridge network for all services, which is why Flask could connect to `mongodb` by name.

### Default vs Custom Bridge — Summary

| Feature | Default Bridge | Custom Bridge |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| DNS by container name | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Network isolation | Shared with all default containers | Isolated to your network |
| Created automatically | Yes | Manual (`docker network create`) |
| Recommended for? | Quick testing only | All real applications |

---

## Host Network

### What Is It?

In host networking mode, the container bypasses Docker's network namespace entirely and uses the host machine's network stack directly. The container has no separate IP — it shares the host's IP and ports.

```bash
docker run -dit --name myapp --network host nginx
# Access via: http://localhost:80 (NOT http://container-ip:80)
```

### When to Use It

- When you need maximum network performance (no virtual network overhead)
- When the app needs to bind to specific host network interfaces
- When doing network monitoring/scanning that needs raw access

### Drawbacks

- No network isolation — the container can access everything the host can
- Port conflicts — if the host is already using port 80, the container can't use it
- Less portable — behavior differs between Linux and Mac/Windows

**Linux only:** Host networking only works as expected on Linux. On Mac and Windows, Docker runs inside a VM, so host networking refers to the VM's network, not your laptop's.

---

## None Network

Complete network isolation. The container has no network interfaces except a loopback (`lo`). No internet, no inter-container communication, nothing.

```bash
docker run -dit --name isolated --network none ubuntu

# The only way to interact:
docker exec -it isolated bash
```

**Use cases:**
- Security testing or sandboxing
- Batch processing jobs that don't need network access
- Running untrusted code in maximum isolation

---

## Overlay Network — Multi-Host Networking

### The Problem Overlay Solves

Bridge networks only work on a single host. If you have a cluster of servers (Docker Swarm or Kubernetes), containers on different servers need to communicate. Overlay networks create a virtual network that spans multiple physical machines.

```
Server 1 ─── Container A ─┐
                           ├─── Overlay Network ─── (looks like same network)
Server 2 ─── Container B ─┘
```

### How It Works

Overlay networks use VXLAN tunneling — packets are encapsulated and sent over the existing host network. The containers don't know or care that they're on different physical machines.

```bash
# Requires Docker Swarm mode
docker swarm init

# Create overlay network
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay

# Deploy services that use the overlay network
docker service create --name web --network my_overlay nginx
docker service create --name backend --network my_overlay openjdk

# Inside the web container, you can reach backend by name:
curl http://backend:8080
```

**In Kubernetes**, overlay networking is handled automatically by CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins like Calico, Flannel, or Cilium. You don't manage it directly — K8s handles it.

---

## Macvlan Network

### What Is It?

Macvlan gives each container its own unique MAC address and IP address on the physical network — as if the container were a real physical machine directly connected to your network switch.

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan

docker run -dit --network my_macvlan nginx
# Container gets an IP like 192.168.1.100 — accessible directly from the network
```

### When to Use It

- Legacy applications that expect to be directly on the network
- When you need the container to appear as a real device to the router
- Network monitoring or packet capture use cases
- No port mapping needed — access the container directly by its IP

---

## IPvlan Network

### What Is It?

Similar to Macvlan but all containers share the same MAC address, only IPs differ. Created to solve a problem with Macvlan in some network environments.

**Why it exists:** some network switches and routers have limits on how many MAC addresses they'll accept per port. Macvlan creates a new MAC per container, which can hit this limit. IPvlan avoids this by sharing the parent interface's MAC address.

```bash
docker network create -d ipvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 my_ipvlan

docker run -dit --network my_ipvlan nginx
```

| | Macvlan | IPvlan |
|--|---------|--------|
| MAC per container | Unique | Shared (parent's MAC) |
| IP per container | Unique | Unique |
| Network visibility | Looks like real device | Looks like real device |
| Supported environments | Most | Environments with MAC limits |

## Network Commands Reference

```bash
# List all networks
docker network ls

# Inspect a network (shows connected containers, IPs, config)
docker network inspect <network-name>

# Create a network
docker network create mynet
docker network create --driver bridge mynet
docker network create --driver overlay mynet

# Connect a running container to a network
docker network connect <network-name> <container-name>
# Example: connect existing container to a new network
docker network connect mynet my-container

# Disconnect a container from a network
docker network disconnect <network-name> <container-name>

# Remove a network
docker network rm <network-name>

# Remove all unused networks
docker network prune
```

## Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes — Networking Comparison

| | Docker Swarm | Kubernetes |
|--|-------------|-----------|
| Network setup | Manual overlay creation | Automatic via CNI |
| Service discovery | Service name DNS | Service name DNS |
| Communication | `curl http://service-name` | `curl http://service-name` |
| Network policies | Limited | Full NetworkPolicy support |
| Complexity | Simpler | More complex but more powerful |

In Kubernetes, all pods can communicate with all other pods by default — no network setup needed. To restrict communication, you use NetworkPolicy resources.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "How do Docker containers communicate with each other?"**
> "By putting them on the same Docker network. On a custom bridge network, Docker's internal DNS resolves container names to IPs automatically, so containers can reach each other by name. On the default bridge, only IP works — names don't resolve, which is why you should always create custom networks for real applications. Docker Compose does this automatically — it creates a custom bridge network for all services in the compose file, which is why a Flask container can connect to a MongoDB container using just the service name."

**Q: "What's the difference between the default bridge and a custom bridge network?"**
> "The key difference is DNS. On the default bridge, containers can only reach each other by IP address — Docker's internal DNS doesn't work there. IPs can change on restart, making this fragile. On a custom bridge network, Docker's DNS automatically resolves container names to their current IPs. Container A can reach Container B just by using its name as a hostname. This is why I always create custom networks for applications — it's more maintainable and resilient."
