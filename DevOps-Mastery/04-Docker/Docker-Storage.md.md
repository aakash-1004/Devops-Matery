## The Core Problem — Container Ephemerality

By default, every container is ephemeral — when it's deleted, all data inside it is gone forever.

This is by design. The whole point of containers is that they're disposable — you can destroy and recreate them at will, and the new container is identical to the old one. This makes deployments reproducible and scaling easy.

But this creates an obvious problem: **what about data that needs to persist?**

If MongoDB runs in a container and you restart or recreate the container, your database is gone. If your Flask app writes log files inside a container, they disappear when the container is removed. If you're developing locally and want code changes to reflect immediately without rebuilding the image, you need a way to inject files from your host machine.

Docker solves this with **storage mechanisms** that exist outside the container's lifecycle.

## How Container Storage Works

Every container has a writable layer on top of the read-only image layers. This writable layer is where all filesystem changes go — files created, modified, or deleted during the container's life.

```
Container (running)
    │
    ├── Writable Layer ← all runtime changes go here
    ├── Image Layer 4 (COPY . .)
    ├── Image Layer 3 (RUN pip install)
    ├── Image Layer 2 (WORKDIR /app)
    └── Image Layer 1 (FROM python:3.12-slim)
```

When the container is deleted with `docker rm`, the writable layer is destroyed. The read-only image layers remain.

---

## Three Storage Options

### 1. Without Volume (Default — Data Is Lost)

When you run a container with no volume configuration, all data goes into the writable layer:

```bash
docker run -d --name test-db mongo:4.4
# Create some data...
docker rm -f test-db
# ALL DATA GONE
```

**Use this when:** the container is stateless and generates no data that needs to persist — web servers serving static content, one-off utility containers.

### 2. Named Volume (Recommended for Production)

A named volume is Docker-managed storage that lives outside the container. Docker creates and manages a directory on the host, but you refer to it by a logical name.

```bash
# Create a named volume
docker volume create myvolume

# Mount it to a container
docker run -d --name webserver -v myvolume:/app nginx
#                                 ^name    ^container path

# If you don't create it first, Docker auto-creates it
docker run -d --name db -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo:4.4
```

**Where Docker stores it:** `/var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume-name>/_data` (Linux)

**What happens to data:**
- Container stops → ✅ data safe
- Container deleted → ✅ data safe
- Volume deleted → ❌ data gone

```bash
# View all volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect a volume (shows mountpoint)
docker volume inspect myvolume

# Remove a specific volume
docker volume rm myvolume

# Remove all unused volumes
docker volume prune
```

**Advantages:**
- Docker manages the exact location — no path confusion
- Easy to back up using Docker tools
- Portable — works the same on any Docker host
- Multiple containers can share the same volume

### 3. Bind Mount (Best for Development)

A bind mount directly maps a directory from your host machine into the container. You specify the exact host path.

```bash
docker run -d --name webserver \
  -v /home/aakash/myapp:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx
#    ^host path            ^container path
```

**What this means:** any file you change in `/home/aakash/myapp` on your host immediately appears in `/usr/share/nginx/html` inside the container — and vice versa. Real-time bidirectional sync.

**What happens to data:**
- Container stops → ✅ data safe (on your host)
- Container deleted → ✅ data safe (on your host)
- You delete the host directory → ❌ data gone

**Advantages:**
- Instant code changes visible in container — no rebuild needed
- Use your normal text editor on the host
- Perfect for development workflows

**Disadvantages:**
- Tied to specific host path — less portable
- If the host path doesn't exist, Docker creates it as root — can cause permission issues
- Exposes host filesystem inside the container — security consideration

## Named Volume vs Bind Mount — When to Use Which

| | Named Volume | Bind Mount |
|--|-------------|-----------|
| Managed by | Docker | You (host filesystem) |
| Location | Docker's internal directory | Any host path you specify |
| Portability | High — same on any Docker host | Low — path must exist on host |
| Performance | Optimized by Docker | Depends on host filesystem |
| Best for | Production data persistence | Local development |
| Use case examples | Databases, app state | Source code, config files |

**The developer workflow:** use bind mounts for source code (so changes reflect immediately) and named volumes for databases (so data persists between container restarts).

---

## Volumes in Docker Compose

Volumes are much easier to manage in Docker Compose. You declare them at two levels:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mongo:4.4
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db       # named volume (service level)
      - ./init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d  # bind mount

  web:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html  # bind mount for development

volumes:
  mongo-data:   # declare the named volume at top level
```

**Service-level vs Top-level volumes:**
- `volumes:` inside a service = mounts for that specific container
- `volumes:` at the top level = declares named volumes that Docker manages

When you run `docker compose down`, named volumes are preserved. Run `docker compose down -v` to also delete volumes (destructive — deletes all data).

## Multi-Stage Build Impact on Storage

Multi-stage builds directly reduce image size by eliminating build tools from the final image:

### Without Multi-Stage (Problem)

```dockerfile
FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-17
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package
CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/app.jar"]
# Final image includes Maven (500MB+), JDK, source code — ~1GB+
```

### With Multi-Stage (Solution)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 — build
FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline          # download deps first (cache layer)
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests      # compile and package

# Stage 2 — runtime only
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim               # much smaller than maven image
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar   # only copy the JAR
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
# Final image: slim JRE + JAR only — ~200MB instead of 1GB+
```

**How `COPY --from=builder` works:** Docker looks at the filesystem state of the `builder` stage and copies just that one file into the current stage. The Maven installation, downloaded dependencies, and source code all stay in the builder stage and are discarded.

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What's the difference between a Docker volume and a bind mount?"**
> "Both provide persistent storage outside the container lifecycle, but they differ in who manages the storage. A named volume is managed by Docker — you give it a name and Docker handles where it's stored (under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). This is portable, consistent, and the right choice for production data like databases. A bind mount maps a specific host directory directly into the container — you specify the exact path. This is great for local development because code changes on your host immediately reflect inside the container without rebuilding. In production I use named volumes for databases and stateful services, and bind mounts only during development."

**Q: "What happens to data in a container when you delete it?"**
> "Container data goes into a writable layer on top of the read-only image layers. When you delete the container with `docker rm`, that writable layer is destroyed. Any data written inside the container without a volume is gone permanently. To persist data, you need either a named volume or a bind mount — both exist outside the container's lifecycle and survive `docker rm`. The volume itself is only deleted when you explicitly run `docker volume rm` or `docker compose down -v`."

**Q: "Why use multi-stage Docker builds?"**
> "To drastically reduce image size. For a Java app, the build stage needs Maven and the full JDK — easily 500MB or more. But to run the app, you only need the JRE and the compiled JAR. Multi-stage builds let you use a heavy image for building, then copy only the build artifact into a minimal runtime image. The final image has no Maven, no source code, no build tools. A Java app image goes from 1GB+ to around 150MB. Smaller images mean faster pulls, smaller attack surface, less storage cost."
