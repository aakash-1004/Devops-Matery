## What Is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It lets you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications as versioned packages called **charts**. Instead of managing 5-10 raw YAML files per environment, you manage one chart with a single `values.yaml`.

**The problem it solves:** Raw Kubernetes manifests have hardcoded values. Deploying the same app to dev, staging, and prod means editing files manually every time. Helm replaces hardcoded values with templates and lets you override them per environment at deploy time.

---

## Core Concepts

### Chart

A package of Kubernetes manifests with templating. Like an apt package but for Kubernetes. Contains:

- `Chart.yaml` — metadata (name, version, description)
- `values.yaml` — default configuration values
- `templates/` — Kubernetes manifests with `{{ }}` placeholders

### Release

A deployed instance of a chart. You can deploy the same chart multiple times with different release names and configs:

```bash
helm install dev-release fullstack-chart/      # dev instance
helm install prod-release fullstack-chart/     # prod instance
```

### values.yaml

The config file. All environment-specific values live here. Templates reference these values using `{{ .Values.key }}`.

### Template

A Kubernetes manifest with Go template placeholders instead of hardcoded values:

```yaml
# Raw manifest (before Helm)
image: aakash0908/flask-backend:v1
replicas: 3

# Helm template
image: {{ .Values.backend.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.backend.image.tag }}
replicas: {{ .Values.backend.replicaCount }}
```

### Repository

Where charts are stored — like Docker Hub but for Helm charts:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```

## Chart We Built Today

**App:** Express frontend + Flask backend + MongoDB Atlas **Repo:** `github.com/aakash-1004/k3s-fullstack` (manifests reference) **Chart location:** `~/devops/fullstack-chart/`

### Chart.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: fullstack-chart
description: Fullstack app - Express frontend + Flask backend + MongoDB Atlas
type: application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: "1.0.0"
```

**Note:** `version` = chart version, `appVersion` = your app version. Keep them separate.

### values.yaml

```yaml
namespace: taskmanager

backend:
  image:
    repository: aakash0908/flask-backend
    tag: v1
  replicaCount: 1
  port: 5000

frontend:
  image:
    repository: aakash0908/express-frontend
    tag: v1
  replicaCount: 1
  port: 3000
  nodePort: 30001

config:
  mongoDb: "users_db"
  mongoCollection: "submissions"
  flaskBackend: "http://flask-backend-service:5000"

secret:
  mongoUri: ""   # Never put real secrets here — pass via --set at deploy time
```

### Secret Template

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secrets
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
type: Opaque
data:
  MONGO_URI: {{ .Values.secret.mongoUri | b64enc | quote }}
```

**Why `b64enc`:** Kubernetes secrets require base64-encoded values. Helm's `b64enc` filter handles encoding automatically — you pass the plain URI via `--set` and Helm encodes it. Never pass a pre-encoded value when using `b64enc` — it will double-encode.

---

## Commands With Explanations

```bash
# Create a new chart scaffold
helm create fullstack-chart
# Generates sample chart structure with example templates — we replaced with our own

# Validate chart syntax without deploying
helm lint fullstack-chart/
# Checks YAML syntax, required fields, and chart structure — catches errors before deploy

# Preview what Helm will generate (dry run)
helm template fullstack-release fullstack-chart/ --set secret.mongoUri="test"
# Renders all templates with values substituted — shows exact Kubernetes YAML that will be applied
# Use this to verify templating is correct before touching the cluster

# Deploy the chart
helm install fullstack-release fullstack-chart/ \
  --set secret.mongoUri="your-plain-mongo-uri"
# --set overrides values at deploy time without modifying values.yaml
# Use for secrets — never put real secrets in values.yaml (it gets committed to Git)

# Update a running release
helm upgrade fullstack-release fullstack-chart/ \
  --set secret.mongoUri="your-plain-mongo-uri"
# Re-applies the chart with new values — creates a new revision, doesn't replace old ones

# Roll back to a specific revision
helm rollback fullstack-release 2
# Instantly restores the exact state from revision 2
# Rollback creates a NEW revision (e.g. revision 4) — never destroys history

# View all revisions of a release
helm history fullstack-release
# Shows every install/upgrade/rollback with timestamps and status
# Use this to decide which revision to roll back to

# View currently active values
helm get values fullstack-release
# Shows user-supplied values for the current release — useful for debugging

# List all releases
helm list
# Shows all deployed releases with status, revision, and chart version

# Remove a release
helm uninstall fullstack-release
# Deletes all Kubernetes resources created by the chart
```

---

## Helm Revision System

Every install, upgrade, and rollback creates a new revision. History is never deleted:

```
REVISION  STATUS      DESCRIPTION
1         superseded  Install complete
2         superseded  Upgrade complete
3         superseded  Rollback to 1
4         deployed    Rollback to 2   ← current
```

**Key insight:** Rollback doesn't go back in time — it creates a new revision with the old config. This means you always have a full audit trail.

---

## Secrets Best Practice in Helm

**Never put secrets in `values.yaml`** — it gets committed to Git.

**Correct approach — pass at deploy time:**

```bash
helm install fullstack-release fullstack-chart/ \
  --set secret.mongoUri="mongodb+srv://..."
```

**Production approach — use external secrets:**

- AWS Secrets Manager + External Secrets Operator
- HashiCorp Vault
- Kubernetes sealed-secrets

For interviews: always mention that `--set` for secrets is fine for dev/learning but production uses a proper secrets manager.

## Troubleshooting Encountered Today

### Issue 1: Stuck Namespace on Deletion

**Symptom:** `kubectl delete namespace taskmanager` hung forever, namespace stuck in `Terminating` **Cause:** Finalizers (cleanup hooks) inside the namespace never completed **Fix:**

```bash
kubectl get namespace taskmanager -o json > /tmp/taskmanager.json
sed -i '/"finalizers"/,/]/d' /tmp/taskmanager.json
kubectl replace --raw "/api/v1/namespaces/taskmanager/finalize" -f /tmp/taskmanager.json
```

**Why it works:** Manually patches the namespace object to remove finalizers, letting Kubernetes proceed with deletion. Common in production — know this fix.

---

### Issue 2: Secret Double-Encoding

**Symptom:** `MONGO_URI` environment variable empty inside pod despite secret existing **Cause:** Passed pre-base64-encoded URI to `--set` while template also had `b64enc` filter → double-encoded **Fix:** Pass plain decoded URI to `--set` — let Helm's `b64enc` handle encoding **Lesson:** When using `b64enc` in Helm templates, always pass plain text values. Helm encodes for you.

---

### Issue 3: Flask CrashLoopBackOff — DNS Resolution Failure (Root Cause: VM Networking)

**Symptom:** Flask backend in CrashLoopBackOff, logs showing:

```
dns.resolver.LifetimeTimeout / NoNameservers: SERVFAIL
All nameservers failed to answer _mongodb._tcp.tram.vriwkc2.mongodb.net IN SRV
```

**Root cause chain:**

1. VirtualBox Adapter 1 was set to **Bridged** (previously) then **NAT Network with no name selected** (invalid config)
2. VM's `enp0s3` interface had **only IPv6 addresses** — no IPv4 internet connectivity
3. `/etc/resolv.conf` pointed to `127.0.0.53` (systemd-resolved stub)
4. systemd-resolved upstream DNS was `2409:40c4:10bb:42ef::b9` (ISP IPv6 DNS)
5. CoreDNS inside k3s forwarded to `/etc/resolv.conf` → `127.0.0.53` → unreachable from pod network
6. All external DNS queries (MongoDB Atlas SRV lookup) failed
7. PyMongo tried to resolve Atlas hostname on startup → crashed → CrashLoopBackOff

**Symptoms that pointed to networking, not app:**

- `ping google.com` worked (IPv6)
- `ping 8.8.8.8` failed (IPv4 unreachable)
- `nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8` — network unreachable
- SSH from devops-labs to EC2 — network unreachable (EC2 is IPv4 only)
- `apt update` on EC2 — connection timed out (before fixing EC2 outbound SG)

**Failed attempts (symptoms, not root cause):**

- Editing CoreDNS configmap to use `8.8.8.8` → k3s reset it on restart
- Using `/etc/coredns/custom/dns.override` with Google DNS → `8.8.8.8` still unreachable
- Restarting CoreDNS → kubernetes plugin stuck at `0/1` due to IPv6/IPv4 CIDR mismatch
- Restarting k3s → picked up IPv6 service CIDR `fd00:43::/112` instead of `10.43.0.0/16`
- Force-patching k3s override.conf with IPv4 CIDRs → fixed k3s but DNS still failing

**Actual fix:**

1. Shut down VM
2. VirtualBox → devops-labs → Settings → Network → Adapter 1 → Changed from **NAT Network** to **NAT**
3. Started VM → `enp0s3` got IPv4 address via DHCP
4. Updated `/etc/coredns/custom/dns.override` with `forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4`
5. Restarted CoreDNS → `1/1 Running`
6. Restarted flask-backend → stayed Running, MongoDB Atlas resolved successfully

**Key lesson:** Always verify basic network connectivity first:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8          # IPv4 internet
ping google.com        # DNS resolution
curl -4 ifconfig.me   # Public IPv4
```

If `ping 8.8.8.8` fails but `ping google.com` works → IPv6-only, no IPv4 internet → fix at VM/network level first.

### Issue 4: k3s Picked Up IPv6 CIDR After Restart

**Symptom:** After restarting k3s, CoreDNS stuck at `0/1`, logs showed:

```
Inconsistent ServiceCIDR: controller [fd00:43::/112], ServiceCIDR [10.43.0.0/16]
```

**Cause:** k3s detected IPv6-only interface and switched to IPv6 service CIDR on restart **Fix:** Added to `/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.d/override.conf`:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3s server \
  --node-ip=192.168.56.101 \
  --service-cidr=10.43.0.0/16 \
  --cluster-cidr=10.42.0.0/16 \
  --flannel-iface=enp0s8
ExecStartPost=/bin/chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

---

### Issue 5: CoreDNS ConfigMap Reset by k3s

**Symptom:** Edited CoreDNS configmap, restarted k3s, configmap reverted to default **Cause:** k3s manages CoreDNS as a built-in addon and overwrites the configmap on restart **Fix:** Use `/etc/coredns/custom/dns.override` — k3s imports this file and it persists across restarts

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/coredns/custom
echo "forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4" | sudo tee /etc/coredns/custom/dns.override
```

## Real-World Context

Helm is used in every production Kubernetes setup:

- **Install third-party tools:** `helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack`
- **Manage your own apps:** version your chart, upgrade with confidence, roll back instantly
- **CI/CD integration:** GitHub Actions runs `helm upgrade` on every merge to main
- **Multi-environment:** `helm install prod-release ./chart -f values.prod.yaml`

In an MNC DevOps role, day 1 you'll be running `helm list` and `helm history` to understand what's deployed, and `helm upgrade` / `helm rollback` to manage releases.

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q: What is Helm and why do we use it?**

> "Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It lets you define your entire application — deployments, services, configmaps, secrets — as a versioned chart with templating. Instead of managing multiple hardcoded YAML files per environment, you have one chart and override values per environment. It also gives you release history and one-command rollback, which is critical in production."

**Q: What is the difference between a Chart, a Release, and a Revision?**

> "A chart is the package — the collection of templates and default values. A release is a deployed instance of that chart — you can deploy the same chart multiple times with different names. A revision is a version of a release — every install, upgrade, or rollback creates a new revision. Helm keeps the full history so you can roll back to any previous state."

**Q: How do you handle secrets in Helm?**

> "You never put secrets in values.yaml because it gets committed to Git. Instead you pass them at deploy time using `--set secret.key=value`. In production, the proper approach is to use an external secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault with the External Secrets Operator, so secrets are never in the pipeline at all."

**Q: How do you roll back a Helm release?**

> "First I run `helm history <release-name>` to see all revisions and identify the last good one. Then I run `helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number>`. Helm creates a new revision with the old configuration — it never deletes history. The rollback is instant because Helm just re-applies the stored state."

**Q: What is `helm template` and when do you use it?**

> "It renders the chart templates with values substituted and prints the final Kubernetes YAML to stdout — without deploying anything. I use it to verify that my templates are generating correct manifests before touching the cluster. It's also useful in CI/CD pipelines to validate charts."

**Q: What happens to the old resources when you run `helm upgrade`?**

> "Helm does a three-way merge — it compares the current live state, the previous chart state, and the new chart state. Resources that exist in the new chart get updated, resources removed from the chart get deleted, and new resources get created. The old revision is marked as superseded but kept in history."
