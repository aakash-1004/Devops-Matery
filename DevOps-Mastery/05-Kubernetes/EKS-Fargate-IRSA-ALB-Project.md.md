# EKS on Fargate + IRSA + ALB Ingress Controller — End to End

## Theory (short)

Kubernetes has no native AWS integration. An `Ingress` object is just a Kubernetes resource — it does nothing on its own. To get a real AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) provisioned automatically, you need the **AWS Load Balancer Controller** running in-cluster, watching for Ingress objects and calling AWS APIs on your behalf.

For that controller pod to call AWS APIs securely (no static access keys), EKS uses **IRSA — IAM Roles for Service Accounts**:

- Every EKS cluster automatically gets an **OIDC issuer** (built into the control plane, no setup needed).
- IAM does **not** trust that issuer by default — you must explicitly register it as an **IAM OIDC provider**.
- An **IAM role** is created with a trust policy scoped to: *only this cluster's OIDC provider, only this specific Kubernetes ServiceAccount*.
- The **Kubernetes ServiceAccount** is annotated with that role's ARN (`eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`).
- At pod creation time, the **Pod Identity Webhook** (built into EKS) sees this annotation and injects:
  - A projected volume containing a signed, auto-rotating OIDC JWT token
  - Env vars `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`
- The AWS SDK inside the pod automatically detects these env vars and calls `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, exchanging the token for **temporary AWS credentials** (~1hr, auto-refreshed) — validated against the IAM OIDC provider.
- No static AWS keys anywhere in the cluster, ever.

Analogy: structurally identical to Keycloak/OIDC trust — an identity provider (Keycloak / EKS OIDC issuer) vouches for identity via signed tokens, and a relying party (client app / AWS IAM) trusts tokens from that specific issuer without a shared static secret.

## Commands (in order, with why)

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Create EKS cluster on Fargate (no EC2 nodegroups — serverless per-pod compute)
eksctl create cluster --name demo-cluster --region us-east-1 --fargate

# 2. Create a Fargate profile for the app namespace
# Why: Fargate has NO default compute. Pods only schedule if their namespace/labels
# match an existing Fargate profile selector. No match = pod stuck Pending forever, silently.
eksctl create fargateprofile \
    --cluster demo-cluster --region us-east-1 \
    --name alb-sample-app --namespace game-2048

# 3. Deploy sample app (Deployment + Service + Ingress)
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.11.0/docs/examples/2048/2048_full.yaml

# 4. Register IAM OIDC provider
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster demo-cluster --region us-east-1 --approve

# Verify registration matches cluster's actual issuer:
oidc_id=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name demo-cluster --region us-east-1 \
  --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text | cut -d '/' -f 5)
aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers | grep $oidc_id

# 5. Create least-privilege IAM policy for the controller
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.11.0/docs/install/iam_policy.json
aws iam create-policy \
    --policy-name AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy \
    --policy-document file://iam_policy.json

# 6. Create IRSA role + matching ServiceAccount (does 2 things in 1 command)
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
  --cluster=demo-cluster --region=us-east-1 \
  --namespace=kube-system --name=aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --role-name AmazonEKSLoadBalancerControllerRole \
  --attach-policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::956179206096:policy/AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy \
  --approve

# 7. Install AWS Load Balancer Controller via Helm
# serviceAccount.create=false is CRITICAL — otherwise Helm creates a fresh,
# unannotated ServiceAccount and silently breaks the IRSA wiring you just built.
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
helm repo update eks
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller -n kube-system \
  --set clusterName=demo-cluster \
  --set serviceAccount.create=false \
  --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --set region=us-east-1 \
  --set vpcId=<vpc-id>

# 8. Verify — Ingress should now have a real ALB address
kubectl get ingress -n game-2048
\`\`\`

## Real-world context

- Standard pattern for exposing any workload on EKS to the internet in production — nobody manually creates ALBs in the console for K8s-managed apps.
- IRSA replaces the old anti-pattern of attaching broad IAM permissions to EC2 node roles (every pod on that node would get the same AWS access — lateral-movement risk).
- Fargate profile "silent Pending" is a real troubleshooting trap — new namespaces need an explicit matching profile or pods never schedule, with zero error messages.
- Same underlying pattern (Ingress/ALB automation) as the Terraform ECS+ALB project — different compute layer (EKS/Fargate vs ECS).

## Interview-ready spoken answer (30-second version)

> "I built an end-to-end EKS project on Fargate — so no EC2 nodes to manage, everything runs as serverless pods. I deployed a sample app with an Ingress resource, then set up the AWS Load Balancer Controller to automatically provision an ALB whenever an Ingress is created. The part I focused on most was security — instead of giving the controller pod a static AWS access key, I wired up IRSA: IAM Roles for Service Accounts, using the cluster's OIDC provider, so the pod gets short-lived, auto-rotating AWS credentials scoped to exactly the permissions it needs. End result: I apply an Ingress YAML, and a real internet-facing ALB gets provisioned automatically, with zero long-lived credentials anywhere in the cluster."

## Interview-ready spoken answer (deep dive / STAR)

**Situation/Task:** Wanted hands-on depth in EKS beyond `kubectl apply` — specifically how AWS and Kubernetes integrate for networking and IAM, since that's where real production issues tend to live.

**Action:**
1. Created an EKS cluster with Fargate profiles instead of managed nodegroups — per-pod isolation, no node patching.
2. Deployed a sample app (Deployment, Service, Ingress) — Ingress alone does nothing until something implements it.
3. Registered the cluster's OIDC issuer as a trusted IAM OIDC provider.
4. Created a least-privilege IAM policy scoped to exactly the ALB/target-group/security-group actions the controller needs.
5. Used `eksctl create iamserviceaccount` to create an IAM role trusted only by that OIDC provider + one specific ServiceAccount, plus the ServiceAccount, annotated with the role ARN.
6. Installed the AWS Load Balancer Controller via Helm pointed at that ServiceAccount. Its pods use the Pod Identity Webhook — auto-injects a signed OIDC token, SDK exchanges it for temporary credentials via `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.
7. Controller picked up the existing Ingress and provisioned a real ALB automatically — target group, listener rules, health checks — no manual console work.

**Result:** App reachable over a public ALB DNS name, fully automated from a single Ingress manifest, zero static AWS credentials anywhere in the cluster. Security-by-design instead of bolted-on IAM.

## Anticipated follow-up questions

- **"Why IRSA over static keys?"** → Static keys are long-lived, hard to rotate, broad blast radius if leaked. IRSA credentials are scoped to one ServiceAccount, auto-rotate hourly, validated cryptographically against the cluster's own OIDC issuer.
- **"What if the ServiceAccount annotation is missing?"** → Pod falls back to the Fargate pod execution role / node IAM role (broader, worse practice) or fails AWS auth entirely depending on SDK config.
- **"What happens if a namespace has no matching Fargate profile?"** → Pod created in the K8s API but never scheduled — stays `Pending` indefinitely, no explicit error. Verified this directly with `eksctl get fargateprofile` during the build.
