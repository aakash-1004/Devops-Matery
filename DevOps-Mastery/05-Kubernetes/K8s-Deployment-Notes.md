## What We Built

Deployed a fullstack app (Express frontend + Flask backend) on Kubernetes using k3s locally.

## Minikube vs k3s

||Minikube|k3s|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Local dev on Windows/Mac|Lightweight production + local dev|
|Runs as|VM inside your machine|Native Linux process|
|Resource usage|Heavy (VM overhead)|Lightweight (~70MB binary)|
|Startup time|2-3 minutes|Seconds|
|Best for|Developers on Windows/Mac|Linux environments, CI/CD, labs|
|Commands|Same kubectl commands|Same kubectl commands|

k3s is better for Linux VMs — no double virtualization overhead.

## Kubernetes Objects Used

### Deployment

Tells Kubernetes: run this container, keep N copies running, restart if it crashes.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-backend
spec:
  replicas: 1                    # how many pod copies to run
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-backend         # find pods with this label
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-backend       # label applied to pods
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask-backend
        image: aakash0908/flask-backend:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
```

### Service

Gives pods a stable network address. Pods get new IPs on restart — Service IP stays permanent.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask-backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: flask-backend    # route to pods with this label
  ports:
  - port: 5000            # service port
    targetPort: 5000      # pod port
  type: ClusterIP         # internal only
```

**Three Service Types:**

|Type|Access|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|ClusterIP|Inside cluster only|Backend services, DBs|
|NodePort|Outside via node IP + port|Local K8s access (30000-32767)|
|LoadBalancer|Public via cloud LB|Production on AWS/GCP/Azure|

### ConfigMap

Stores non-sensitive configuration as key-value pairs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  MONGO_DB: "users_db"
  MONGO_COLLECTION: "submissions"
  FLASK_BACKEND: "http://flask-backend-service:5000"
```

### Secret

Stores sensitive data (passwords, API keys). Values are base64 encoded.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  MONGO_URI: <base64-encoded-value>
```

**Important:** Base64 is NOT encryption — anyone can decode it:

```bash
echo "encoded==" | base64 --decode
```

Real security comes from RBAC (who can read secrets) and never committing to Git.

## ConfigMap vs Secret

||ConfigMap|Secret|
|---|---|---|
|Use for|Non-sensitive config|Passwords, API keys, tokens|
|Storage|Plain text|Base64 encoded|
|Examples|DB name, collection, URLs|MONGO_URI, API_KEY|
|Commit to Git?|Yes (safe)|Never|

## How Kubernetes DNS Works

When you create a Service named `flask-backend-service`, Kubernetes automatically creates a DNS entry:

```
flask-backend-service         → resolves within same namespace
flask-backend-service.default → resolves across namespaces
```

Frontend calls `http://flask-backend-service:5000` — Kubernetes DNS resolves it to the Service's ClusterIP, which routes to the Flask pod.

This is why service names work instead of IPs — pods get new IPs on restart, service DNS stays permanent.

## Docker Compose vs Kubernetes

|Docker Compose|Kubernetes|
|---|---|
|Single `docker-compose.yml`|Multiple YAML manifests|
|`services:`|Deployment + Service per component|
|`networks:`|Services + DNS (automatic)|
|`env_file:`|ConfigMap + Secret|
|Manual restart|Self-healing (automatic restart)|
|No scaling|`replicas: N`|
|Dev/staging|Production ready|

---

## Rolling Update — What Happens on kubectl apply

When you update a Deployment and apply it:

```
Old ReplicaSet (scaled to 0) ← kept for rollback
New ReplicaSet (scaled to 1) ← new config running

kubectl get all shows both:
replicaset/flask-backend-7657c79d9   0/0/0  ← old
replicaset/flask-backend-5bccbf57f9  1/1/1  ← new
```

This is normal — Kubernetes keeps old ReplicaSet for rollback.

---

## k3s Setup

```bash
# Fix kubeconfig permissions (resets on restart)
sudo chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

# Permanent fix — runs chmod after every k3s start
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.d
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.d/override.conf
# Add: [Service]
#      ExecStartPost=/bin/chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart k3s

# Set KUBECONFIG permanently
echo "export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify
kubectl get nodes
```

---

## Bugs Encountered

|Bug|Cause|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|`permission denied` on k3s.yaml|File owned by root|`sudo chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`|
|`ImagePullBackOff`|Docker Hub rate limit / DNS|Kubernetes retried automatically, resolved overnight|
|`nodePort already allocated`|Port 30000 taken|Changed to 30001|
|`bad auth: authentication failed`|Wrong password in Secret|Re-encoded with correct password using `-w 0`|
|Base64 line break in Secret|Base64 split across two lines|Use `base64 -w 0` for single line output|
|Hardcoded MONGO_URI in deployment|Plain text password in YAML|Moved to Kubernetes Secret|

## Security Best Practices

```
❌ Wrong:
   env:
   - name: MONGO_URI
     value: "mongodb+srv://user:password@..."   ← plain text in YAML

✅ Correct:
   env:
   - name: MONGO_URI
     valueFrom:
       secretKeyRef:
         name: app-secrets
         key: MONGO_URI
```

Always:

- Store sensitive values in Kubernetes Secrets
- Add `secret.yml` to `.gitignore`
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use strong passwords without special characters in URIs
- In production: use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault

## Interview Answers

**Q: What is the difference between a ConfigMap and a Secret in Kubernetes?**

> "Both store configuration data as key-value pairs that get injected into pods as environment variables or mounted as files. The difference is ConfigMaps are for non-sensitive data stored in plain text — things like database names, feature flags, URLs. Secrets are for sensitive data like passwords and API keys, stored base64 encoded. It's important to note that base64 is not encryption — real security comes from RBAC policies controlling who can read secrets and never committing them to Git."

**Q: What is a Kubernetes Service and why do you need it?**

> "A Service gives a stable network endpoint to a set of pods. Pods are ephemeral — they get new IP addresses every time they restart. Without a Service, other pods would lose track of where to send requests. A Service has a permanent ClusterIP and DNS name that always routes to healthy pods matching its selector labels. There are three types: ClusterIP for internal communication, NodePort for external access in local clusters, and LoadBalancer for cloud environments."

**Q: What happens when you run kubectl apply on an updated Deployment?**

> "Kubernetes performs a rolling update. It creates a new ReplicaSet with the updated pod spec and gradually scales it up while scaling down the old ReplicaSet. The old ReplicaSet is kept at zero replicas for rollback purposes. This ensures zero downtime during updates — new pods are running before old ones are terminated. If something goes wrong you can run kubectl rollout undo to revert to the previous ReplicaSet."

**Q: How do pods in different Deployments communicate in Kubernetes?**

> "Through Services and Kubernetes DNS. When you create a Service, Kubernetes automatically registers a DNS entry for it. Pods can reach other pods by calling the Service name as a hostname — for example http://flask-backend-service:5000. Kubernetes DNS resolves the service name to its ClusterIP, which then load balances across all healthy pods matching the Service's selector. This is why you use service names instead of pod IPs — pod IPs change on restart, service DNS stays permanent."
