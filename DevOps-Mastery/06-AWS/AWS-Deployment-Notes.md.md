## What We Built

Three progressive deployment approaches for the same fullstack app (Express frontend + Flask backend):

|Part|Approach|Key Learning|
|---|---|---|
|1|Both apps on single EC2|Docker Compose on cloud, security groups|
|2|Separate EC2 instances|Private IP communication, VPC networking|
|3|ECR + ECS + VPC|Managed containers, no server management|

## Core AWS Concepts

### EC2 — Elastic Compute Cloud

A virtual machine running in AWS. You pick the OS, instance type, storage. You are responsible for everything inside — OS updates, runtime installation, process management.

```
You manage:
- OS (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)
- Runtime (Docker, Node.js, Python)
- Process management (systemd, PM2)
- Security patches

AWS manages:
- Physical hardware
- Hypervisor
- Network infrastructure
```

### Security Group

Virtual firewall for EC2 instances and ECS tasks. Controls inbound and outbound traffic.

```
Inbound rules  = who can connect TO your resource
Outbound rules = where your resource can connect TO
                 (default: allow all outbound)
```

Key rule format:

```
Type       | Port | Source
-----------|------|----------
SSH        | 22   | 0.0.0.0/0  (allow SSH from anywhere)
Custom TCP | 3000 | 0.0.0.0/0  (allow port 3000 from anywhere)
HTTP       | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0  (allow HTTP from anywhere)
```

`0.0.0.0/0` = allow from any IP address

### VPC — Virtual Private Cloud

Your private isolated network inside AWS. All EC2 instances and ECS tasks run inside a VPC.

```
VPC: 172.31.0.0/16
├── Public Subnet: 172.31.0.0/24  (internet accessible)
├── Public Subnet: 172.31.1.0/24
└── Private Subnet: 172.31.2.0/24 (internal only)
```

**Public IP vs Private IP:**

```
Public IP:  accessible from internet, changes on restart
Private IP: only accessible within VPC, permanent
            free to use, faster, more secure
```

Always use private IPs for internal service communication.

### CIDR Block

Notation for expressing a range of IP addresses.

```
172.31.0.0/16
│          │
│          └── prefix length: first 16 bits are fixed
└── base IP

Fixed bits = 16, Free bits = 32-16 = 16
Total IPs = 2^16 = 65,536
Range: 172.31.0.0 → 172.31.255.255
```

|CIDR|IPs|Common Use|
|---|---|---|
|/8|16M|Large enterprise VPC|
|/16|65K|Default AWS VPC|
|/24|256|Single subnet|
|/32|1|Single IP|
|0.0.0.0/0|All|"anywhere" in security groups|

---

## Part 1 — Single EC2 Deployment

### Architecture

```
Internet
    |
    | port 3000
    v
EC2 Instance (Ubuntu)
├── Express Container (port 3000)
│     |
│     | http://backend:5000 (Docker network)
│     v
└── Flask Container (port 5000)
      |
      v
  MongoDB Atlas
```

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. SSH into EC2
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC-IP>

# 2. Install Docker
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker

# 3. Create docker-compose.yml (use images from Docker Hub)
# 4. Create backend/.env with MongoDB credentials
# 5. Run
docker-compose up -d
```

### docker-compose.yml for Single EC2

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: aakash0908/flask-backend:v1
    container_name: flask-backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    env_file:
      - ./backend/.env
    networks:
      - app-network
    restart: always

  frontend:
    image: aakash0908/express-frontend:v1
    container_name: express-frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_BACKEND=http://backend:5000
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - app-network
    restart: always

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Key Points

- Both containers on same machine → Docker bridge network handles communication
- Frontend uses service name `backend` as hostname — Docker DNS resolves it
- Security group must open ports 22, 80, 3000, 5000
- `.env` file must be created manually on the server (never in Git)
- Use Docker Hub images — no need to copy source code to EC2

### Amazon Linux vs Ubuntu

- Amazon Linux uses `ec2-user` as SSH username
- Ubuntu uses `ubuntu` as SSH username
- Amazon Linux uses `yum` package manager
- Ubuntu uses `apt` package manager
- Prefer Ubuntu — matches local dev environment, fewer surprises

## Part 2 — Separate EC2 Instances

### Architecture

```
Internet
    |
    | port 3000
    v
EC2-1 (Frontend) - 52.66.195.100
Express Container
    |
    | http://172.31.35.134:5000 (private IP)
    | traffic goes through AWS VPC
    v
EC2-2 (Backend) - 13.201.53.238
Flask Container (port 5000)
    |
    v
MongoDB Atlas
```

### How They Communicate

```
Same EC2:       Docker bridge network → service name works
Different EC2:  AWS VPC network → must use private IP

Frontend calls: http://172.31.35.134:5000
                       ↑
                 backend's PRIVATE IP
                 resolved by AWS VPC routing
                 never hits public internet
```

### Why Private IP Not Public IP

```
Private IP:              Public IP:
stays in AWS network     goes to internet + back
faster                   slower
free                     costs data transfer $
more secure              exposed publicly
stable                   changes on instance restart
```

### docker-compose.yml for Frontend Instance

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: aakash0908/express-frontend:v1
    container_name: express-frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_BACKEND=http://<BACKEND-PRIVATE-IP>:5000
    restart: always
```

### docker-compose.yml for Backend Instance

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: aakash0908/flask-backend:v1
    container_name: flask-backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    restart: always
```

### Security Groups for Part 2

```
frontend-sg:
  inbound: 22, 3000, 80

backend-sg:
  inbound: 22, 5000
```

### .env File Location

When single service per instance — put `.env` at root next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```
backend-app/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── .env              ← root level, cleaner
```

Multiple services — use separate folders:

```
fullstack-app/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── backend/.env
└── frontend/.env
```

---

## Part 3 — ECR + ECS + VPC

### ECR — Elastic Container Registry

AWS's private Docker image registry.

```
Docker Hub:          ECR:
public by default    private by default
rate limited         no rate limits
outside AWS          inside AWS (faster pulls)
Docker credentials   IAM authentication
```

**Image URI format:**

```
956179206096.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flask_backend:v1
│             │              │                  │              │
account-id    service        region             repo-name      tag
```

**Push images to ECR:**

```bash
# 1. Authenticate Docker to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
  956179206096.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

# 2. Tag image for ECR
docker tag local-image:latest \
  956179206096.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flask_backend:v1

# 3. Push
docker push 956179206096.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flask_backend:v1
```

### ECS — Elastic Container Service

AWS managed container platform. You define containers, AWS runs them.

**Key concepts:**

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Cluster|Logical grouping of container workloads|
|Task Definition|Blueprint for a container (image, CPU, memory, ports, env vars)|
|Task|A running instance of a Task Definition|
|Service|Ensures N tasks are always running, restarts on failure|
|Fargate|Serverless launch type — no EC2 management needed|

```
Task Definition = recipe
Task            = one meal cooked from that recipe
Service         = chef ensuring N meals are always ready
Cluster         = the kitchen
```

**Fargate vs EC2 launch type:**

```
EC2 launch type:        Fargate:
you manage EC2          AWS manages infrastructure
cheaper at scale        more expensive but simpler
more control            less control
good for steady load    good for variable load
```

### Architecture for Part 3

```
Browser
   |
   | port 3000
   v
ECS Fargate Task (Express Frontend)
Public IP: 13.233.135.211
   |
   | http://3.111.147.201:5000
   | (backend task's public IP)
   v
ECS Fargate Task (Flask Backend)
Public IP: 3.111.147.201
   |
   v
MongoDB Atlas
```

### Setup Steps Summary

```
1. Create ECR repositories (flask_backend, express_frontend)
2. Push images to ECR
3. Create ECS Cluster (Fargate)
4. Create Task Definition for backend
   - Image: ECR URI
   - Port: 5000
   - Env vars: MONGO_URI, MONGO_DB, MONGO_COLLECTION
5. Create Task Definition for frontend
   - Image: ECR URI
   - Port: 3000
   - Env var: FLASK_BACKEND=http://<backend-task-ip>:5000
6. Create Security Groups (ecs-backend-sg, ecs-frontend-sg)
7. Run backend service → get public IP
8. Update frontend task definition with backend IP
9. Run frontend service → get public IP
10. Access http://<frontend-ip>:3000
```

### ECS Service Linked Role

ECS requires a service linked role to manage resources on your behalf. If cluster creation fails with role error:

```bash
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ecs.amazonaws.com
```

### IAM User for ECR (Best Practice)

Never use admin credentials for specific tasks. Create a dedicated user:

```
IAM → Users → Create user
  Name: ecr-user
  Policy: AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

Configure on VM:
  aws configure --profile ecr-user

Use for ECR login:
  aws ecr get-login-password --profile ecr-user ...
```

## Key Differences Between Parts

```
Part 1 — Single EC2:
  ✅ Simple setup
  ✅ Cheapest
  ❌ Single point of failure
  ❌ Can't scale independently
  Communication: Docker bridge network

Part 2 — Separate EC2:
  ✅ Independent scaling
  ✅ Fault isolation
  ❌ Manual server management
  ❌ Manual IP configuration
  Communication: AWS VPC private IP

Part 3 — ECS Fargate:
  ✅ No server management
  ✅ Auto-restart on failure
  ✅ Easy scaling
  ❌ More expensive
  ❌ IP changes on task restart (use Load Balancer in production)
  Communication: Public IP (use ALB + private subnet in production)
```

---

## SSH Key Best Practice

Always create key pairs from Linux CLI — never download from Windows:

```bash
# Creates key and saves directly to Linux filesystem
aws ec2 create-key-pair \
  --key-name my-key \
  --query 'KeyMaterial' \
  --output text > ~/my-key.pem

chmod 400 ~/my-key.pem
```

Windows downloads corrupt `.pem` files with `\r` characters → SSH fails.

---

## SSH Usernames by AMI

|AMI|Username|
|---|---|
|Ubuntu|`ubuntu`|
|Amazon Linux|`ec2-user`|
|RHEL|`ec2-user`|
|Debian|`admin`|
|CentOS|`centos`|

---

## Cost Management

```bash
# Stop ECS tasks (set desired count to 0)
# EC2: Instance state → Stop
# ECS: Service → Update → Desired tasks: 0

# Always stop resources when not using them
# Fargate charges per second of vCPU/memory usage
# EC2 t3.micro is free tier eligible
# ECR: 500MB free per month
```

---

## Commands Reference

```bash
# SSH into EC2
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC-IP>

# Docker on EC2
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker

# ECR authentication
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
  <account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

# Tag for ECR
docker tag <local-image> <ecr-uri>:<tag>

# Push to ECR
docker push <ecr-uri>:<tag>

# Check running containers
docker ps

# Check container logs
docker logs <container-name>

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## Interview Answers

**Q: What is the difference between a public and private subnet in AWS?**

> "A public subnet has a route to an Internet Gateway, so resources in it can have public IPs and receive traffic from the internet. A private subnet has no direct internet route — resources can only be reached from within the VPC. In production, you'd put your frontend load balancer in a public subnet and backend services in a private subnet for security."

**Q: How do you make containers in separate EC2 instances communicate?**

> "Containers on separate EC2 instances can't use Docker's internal DNS since they're on different machines. Instead they communicate over the AWS VPC network using private IPs. You configure the frontend container's environment variable with the backend's private IP. Private IPs are used instead of public IPs because they're faster, free, more secure, and traffic stays within AWS's network."

**Q: What is ECS Fargate and why use it over EC2?**

> "ECS Fargate is a serverless container platform where you define what to run and AWS handles the underlying infrastructure. With EC2 launch type you manage the servers yourself — patching, scaling, capacity planning. With Fargate you just specify CPU and memory requirements and AWS runs the containers. It's more expensive per unit but reduces operational overhead significantly, which is why it's preferred for teams that want to focus on applications rather than infrastructure."

**Q: What is ECR and why use it instead of Docker Hub?**

> "ECR is AWS's private container registry. It integrates natively with ECS using IAM authentication — no separate credentials needed. Images stored in ECR are in the same region as your ECS tasks, so pulls are faster and free. Docker Hub has rate limits on pulls and stores images outside AWS, adding latency and potential reliability issues."

**Q: What is a Security Group in AWS?**

> "A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources. It's stateful — if you allow inbound traffic on a port, the response traffic is automatically allowed outbound. Rules specify protocol, port range, and source IP range using CIDR notation. 0.0.0.0/0 means allow from any IP. Unlike NACLs which operate at subnet level, security groups operate at the resource level."
