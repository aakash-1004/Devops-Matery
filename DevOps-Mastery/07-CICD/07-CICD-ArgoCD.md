## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a deployment model where **Git is the single source of truth** for your infrastructure and applications. Instead of pushing changes to the cluster, an agent inside the cluster pulls from Git and ensures the cluster always matches what's in Git.

**Push-based CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins):**

```
Code push → Pipeline triggers → Pipeline SSHs into server → Deploys
```

The pipeline pushes changes TO the cluster.

**Pull-based CI/CD (GitOps/ArgoCD):**

```
Code push → Git repo updated → ArgoCD detects change → Pulls and deploys
```

The cluster pulls changes FROM Git.

---

## Push vs Pull — Key Differences

|Push-based (GitHub Actions)|Pull-based (GitOps/ArgoCD)|
|---|---|
|Pipeline has cluster credentials|Cluster has Git credentials|
|Manual drift detection|Auto-detects and fixes drift|
|Rollback = re-run old pipeline|Rollback = `git revert`|
|Audit trail in CI logs|Audit trail in Git history|
|Hard to recover from cluster wipe|Git repo = full cluster state|
|Anyone with kubectl can change cluster|All changes must go through Git|

---

## What is Drift?

**Drift** = when what's running in the cluster doesn't match what's defined in Git.

Example: Developer runs `kubectl scale deployment flask-backend --replicas=5` directly on the cluster. Git still says `replicaCount: 1`. The cluster has drifted from the desired state.

Without GitOps: drift is invisible and accumulates over time. With ArgoCD + `selfHeal: true`: drift is detected and reverted automatically within seconds.

---

## What is ArgoCD?

ArgoCD is a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It:

- Runs **inside** your Kubernetes cluster as a set of pods
- Watches a Git repo for changes
- Compares the Git state to the live cluster state
- Automatically syncs the cluster to match Git

ArgoCD is independent of your app — you can uninstall it and your apps keep running, just unmanaged.

---

## What is a CRD?

CRD = **Custom Resource Definition**. Lets you extend Kubernetes with custom resource types.

Kubernetes has built-in types: `Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`.

ArgoCD adds its own types:

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd    # ArgoCD CRD
kubectl get appprojects -n argocd     # ArgoCD CRD
```

Other tools using CRDs:

- Prometheus → `ServiceMonitor`, `PrometheusRule`
- Cert-manager → `Certificate`, `Issuer`
- Helm operator → `HelmRelease`

---

## ArgoCD Components

When you install ArgoCD, it deploys these pods:

|Component|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`argocd-server`|API server + UI|
|`argocd-application-controller`|Watches cluster state, detects drift|
|`argocd-repo-server`|Clones and renders Git repos|
|`argocd-redis`|Caching layer|
|`argocd-dex-server`|SSO/authentication|
|`argocd-applicationset-controller`|Manages ApplicationSets (multiple apps)|
|`argocd-notifications-controller`|Slack/email notifications|

---

## Installation

```bash
# Create dedicated namespace
kubectl create namespace argocd
# Why: ArgoCD has many components — isolating in its own namespace keeps kube-system clean

# Install using official manifest
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml --server-side --force-conflicts
# Why --server-side: avoids annotation size limit error on large CRDs (262144 byte limit)
# Why --force-conflicts: resolves field ownership conflicts when re-applying

# Verify all pods are running
kubectl get pods -n argocd
# All 7 pods should show 1/1 Running before proceeding

# Expose UI via NodePort
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
# Why: default is ClusterIP (cluster-internal only) — NodePort exposes it on the VM IP

# Get the NodePort
kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd
# Note the port mapped to 443 — that's your UI port

# Get initial admin password
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
# Why base64 -d: Kubernetes secrets are base64 encoded — decode to get plain password
# Username: admin
```

**Access UI:** `https://<node-ip>:<nodeport>` — accept self-signed certificate warning.

## The ArgoCD Application Object

The `Application` is ArgoCD's CRD that defines what to deploy, from where, and to where:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: fullstack-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/aakash-1004/fullstack-chart.git
    targetRevision: main      # branch to watch
    path: .                   # path inside repo where chart lives
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - values.yaml
      parameters:
        - name: secret.mongoUri
          value: "your-plain-mongo-uri"   # equivalent to --set in helm
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc   # local cluster
    namespace: taskmanager
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true       # delete resources removed from Git
      selfHeal: true    # revert manual cluster changes back to Git state
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true   # create namespace if it doesn't exist
```

**Apply it:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f argocd-app.yaml
# This registers the Application with ArgoCD — after this ArgoCD takes over
```

---

## Sync Status vs Health Status

ArgoCD shows two statuses for every application:

**Sync Status:**

- `Synced` — cluster matches Git state exactly
- `OutOfSync` — cluster differs from Git (drift detected)
- `Unknown` — ArgoCD can't determine state

**Health Status:**

- `Healthy` — all resources are running correctly
- `Progressing` — resources are being updated
- `Degraded` — something is wrong (pod crash, etc.)
- `Missing` — resource doesn't exist in cluster

**Best state:** `Healthy + Synced` — everything matches Git and is running correctly.

**Important:** `Synced` does NOT mean ArgoCD just deployed. It means the current cluster state already matches Git. ArgoCD may have adopted existing resources without redeploying them.

---

## Sync Modes

**Manual sync:** You click Sync in UI or run `argocd app sync <app-name>`. ArgoCD only syncs when you tell it to.

**Automated sync (what we configured):**

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    prune: true
    selfHeal: true
```

ArgoCD polls Git every 3 minutes. On change detected → syncs automatically.

---

## Polling vs Webhooks

**Current setup (polling):**

```
ArgoCD → GitHub every 3 min: "anything changed?"
```

Works because it's outbound from cluster to GitHub.

**Webhook (faster):**

```
GitHub → ArgoCD instantly on every push
```

Requires ArgoCD to be publicly accessible (needs public URL).

- Local lab: use ngrok to create a tunnel
- Production (EKS/GKE): cluster has a public endpoint, webhook is trivial to set up

**Interview answer:** "In production we set up GitHub webhooks so ArgoCD syncs instantly on every push. Locally I used polling for the lab since the cluster isn't publicly accessible."

---

## Self-Healing Demo

```bash
# Scale deployment manually — this creates drift
kubectl scale deployment flask-backend -n taskmanager --replicas=3
# ArgoCD detects: Git says 1, cluster has 3 → OutOfSync
# With selfHeal: true → ArgoCD reverts to 1 automatically within seconds
```

This is why GitOps is powerful — **nobody can make permanent changes by running kubectl directly**. Every change must go through Git.

---

## Full GitOps Deployment Flow

```
1. Edit values.yaml (e.g. replicaCount: 1 → 2)
2. git add . && git commit -m "Scale backend to 2"
3. git push origin main
4. ArgoCD detects change (poll or webhook)
5. ArgoCD syncs → kubectl scale deployment flask-backend --replicas=2
6. New pod appears in cluster
7. Status: Healthy + Synced
```

No SSH. No manual kubectl. No pipeline credentials. Just Git.

---

## App of Apps Pattern (Concept)

Used in large setups managing 50+ applications. One "parent" ArgoCD Application manages multiple "child" Applications.

```
root-app (Application)
  ├── frontend-app (Application)
  ├── backend-app (Application)
  ├── monitoring-app (Application)
  └── ingress-app (Application)
```

Deploy the root app → ArgoCD deploys all children automatically. Used at MNC scale where one team manages dozens of microservices.

**Interview:** "For large setups we use the App of Apps pattern where a root Application manages all other Applications. This gives us one place to bootstrap an entire cluster."

---

## Commands With Explanations

```bash
# Check ArgoCD applications
kubectl get applications -n argocd
# Lists all ArgoCD Application objects — shows sync and health status

# Force immediate sync (instead of waiting for poll)
# Via UI: click SYNC button
# Via CLI (if argocd CLI installed):
argocd app sync fullstack-app

# Check application details
kubectl describe application fullstack-app -n argocd
# Shows full status, last sync time, error messages if any

# Delete an ArgoCD application (doesn't delete cluster resources by default)
kubectl delete application fullstack-app -n argocd

# Check ArgoCD server logs
kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-server
# Useful for debugging sync issues
```

## Troubleshooting

|Problem|Cause|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|CRD annotation too long error|Large CRD exceeds 262144 byte client-side limit|Use `--server-side` flag|
|Field conflict on server-side apply|Previous client-side apply owns fields|Add `--force-conflicts` flag|
|App stuck OutOfSync|Manual cluster changes conflicting with Git|Click Hard Refresh in UI, then Sync|
|Webhook not receiving|ArgoCD not publicly accessible|Use ngrok tunnel or deploy to cloud cluster|

---

## Real-World Context

ArgoCD is the industry standard for Kubernetes GitOps:

- Every MNC running Kubernetes uses ArgoCD or Flux (similar tool)
- DevOps engineers manage deployments via Git PRs, not kubectl
- On-call engineers use ArgoCD UI to check app health and trigger rollbacks
- Rollback = `git revert` + push → ArgoCD auto-deploys the reverted state

In an interview: "We use ArgoCD for GitOps — all deployments go through Git. ArgoCD watches the repo and syncs the cluster automatically. Self-healing ensures nobody can introduce drift by running kubectl manually."

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q: What is GitOps and how is it different from traditional CI/CD?**

> "GitOps is a deployment model where Git is the single source of truth. In traditional CI/CD like GitHub Actions, the pipeline pushes changes to the cluster — the pipeline needs cluster credentials. In GitOps, an agent like ArgoCD runs inside the cluster and pulls from Git. The cluster reaches out to Git, not the other way around. This means no cluster credentials in the pipeline, full audit trail in Git history, and automatic drift detection."

**Q: What is drift and how does ArgoCD handle it?**

> "Drift is when the live cluster state doesn't match what's defined in Git — for example someone runs kubectl scale manually. ArgoCD continuously compares the live state to the Git state. With selfHeal enabled, it automatically reverts any manual changes back to what Git says. This ensures the cluster always reflects the desired state defined in Git."

**Q: What is the difference between Synced and Healthy in ArgoCD?**

> "Synced means the cluster state matches Git — no drift. Healthy means all the resources are actually running correctly — pods up, no crashes. You want both green. You could be Synced but Degraded if the config in Git deploys correctly but the app itself is crashing. Or OutOfSync but Healthy if someone manually added extra resources to the cluster."

**Q: How do you roll back a deployment with ArgoCD?**

> "Since Git is the source of truth, rollback is just a git revert. You revert the commit that introduced the bad change, push it, and ArgoCD automatically syncs the cluster back to the previous state. You can also use the ArgoCD UI to sync to a specific Git commit directly."

**Q: What is the App of Apps pattern?**

> "It's an ArgoCD pattern for managing large numbers of applications. You create one root Application that points to a directory of other Application manifests in Git. When ArgoCD syncs the root app, it creates all the child Applications, which then each sync their own services. It's how you bootstrap an entire cluster from a single Git repo."

**Q: How do you make ArgoCD sync faster than the default 3 minute poll?**

> "You set up a webhook in GitHub that notifies ArgoCD instantly on every push. The webhook sends a POST request to the ArgoCD API server endpoint. This requires ArgoCD to be publicly accessible — in production on EKS or GKE that's straightforward since the cluster has a public endpoint. For local development you'd use ngrok to create a tunnel."
