## What Is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built directly into GitHub. You define pipelines as YAML files inside your repository — no external server needed. GitHub manages the runners (the machines that execute your pipeline).

**Key difference from Jenkins**: Jenkins requires you to maintain a server. GitHub Actions is fully managed — you write YAML, push code, GitHub does the rest.

## Jenkins → GitHub Actions Mental Map

| Jenkins Concept   | GitHub Actions Equivalent        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Jenkinsfile`     | `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml` |
| Stage             | `job`                            |
| Step              | `step`                           |
| Agent             | `runner` (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`)  |
| Credentials store | `Secrets` (repo Settings)        |
| Webhook trigger   | `on: push`                       |
| Pipeline library  | `uses:` (reusable Actions)       |
|                   |                                  |

## The 4 Core Building Blocks

### 1. Workflow

The entire pipeline file. Stored at `.github/workflows/<name>.yml`. One repo can have multiple workflows.

### 2. Trigger (`on:`)

Defines what event starts the pipeline.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

Other triggers: `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger)

### 3. Job

A group of steps that run on one runner. Jobs run in parallel by default unless you use `needs:`.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

### 4. Step

One unit of work inside a job — either a shell command (`run:`) or a pre-built action (`uses:`).

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Build Docker image
    run: docker build -t myapp .
```

---

## GitHub Actions Superpower — `uses:`

Pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace. Instead of writing boilerplate, you call someone else's action:

```yaml
# Log into Docker Hub in 4 lines instead of 10
- uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Common actions used in real pipelines:

- `actions/checkout@v3` — checks out your repo code
- `docker/login-action@v3` — logs into Docker Hub
- `docker/build-push-action@v5` — builds and pushes Docker image
- `appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0` — SSHs into a remote server and runs commands

---

## Pipeline We Built Today

**Repo**: `github.com/aakash-1004/flask-mongo-app` **Flow**: push to master → build Docker image → push to Docker Hub → SSH into EC2 → pull image → restart container

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: aakash0908/flask-mongo-app:latest

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-push

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to EC2
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ubuntu
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            docker pull aakash0908/flask-mongo-app:latest
            docker stop flask-app || true
            docker rm flask-app || true
            docker run -d \
              --name flask-app \
              -p 80:5000 \
              -e MONGO_URI="${{ secrets.MONGO_URI }}" \
              -e MONGO_DB="${{ secrets.MONGO_DB }}" \
              -e MONGO_COLLECTION="${{ secrets.MONGO_COLLECTION }}" \
              aakash0908/flask-mongo-app:latest
```

## Secrets Management

Secrets are stored in **GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Never hardcode credentials in the YAML file.

Secrets used in this pipeline:

|Secret|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`|Docker Hub login|
|`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`|Docker Hub access token (not password)|
|`EC2_HOST`|Public IP of EC2 instance|
|`EC2_SSH_KEY`|Full contents of `.pem` private key|
|`MONGO_URI`|MongoDB Atlas connection string|
|`MONGO_DB`|Database name|
|`MONGO_COLLECTION`|Collection name|

Reference in YAML: `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

## Dockerfile Created for flask-mongo-app

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

**Why `requirements.txt` is copied first**: Docker layer caching — dependencies only reinstall when `requirements.txt` changes, not on every code change. Faster builds.

**Why gunicorn not `python app.py`**: gunicorn is a production-grade WSGI server. Flask's built-in server is for development only.

---

## .dockerignore

```
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.git
.gitignore
```

**Why**: Prevents `.env` (secrets), `venv/` (huge), and `.git/` from being copied into the image. Keeps image small and secure.

---

## Key Concepts — `needs:` for Job Ordering

By default, jobs run in parallel. `needs:` makes a job wait for another to finish first:

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build-and-push  # deploy won't start until build-and-push succeeds
```

If `build-and-push` fails, `deploy` is skipped automatically.

---

## Common Gotchas Encountered

- **Branch mismatch**: pipeline set to `main` but repo uses `master` — workflow never triggers. Always check your default branch name.
- **EC2 outbound rules**: "Custom TCP port 0" does NOT mean all traffic. Must explicitly set Type to "All traffic".
- **Windows SSH key permissions**: `icacls` must show only your user — `BUILTIN\Users` access causes `Permission denied (publickey)`.
- **VirtualBox IPv6 only**: devops-labs VM has no IPv4 on internet-facing adapter — can't SSH to IPv4 addresses. Workaround: use Windows PowerShell for EC2 SSH.

---

## EC2 Docker Install (for fresh Ubuntu instances)

```bash
# Force IPv4 for apt (fixes IPv6-only network issues)
echo 'Acquire::ForceIPv4 "true";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4

# Install Docker via official script
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add ubuntu user to docker group (no sudo needed for docker commands)
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# Exit and SSH back in for group change to take effect
exit
```

---

## Real-World Context

This pipeline pattern is used in production at most MNC-level companies:

- Dev pushes code → automated tests run → Docker image built → deployed to staging/prod
- The `needs:` pattern ensures deployment only happens after successful build
- Secrets management via GitHub Secrets is the standard for smaller teams; larger orgs use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault

## Interview-Ready Spoken Answers

**Q: How does GitHub Actions differ from Jenkins?**

"GitHub Actions is a managed CI/CD platform built into GitHub — you write YAML workflows and GitHub provides the runners. Jenkins requires you to manage your own server and plugins. Actions is faster to set up and has a huge marketplace of pre-built actions. Jenkins gives more control and is better for complex enterprise setups. For most modern cloud-native projects, GitHub Actions is the go-to choice."

**Q: How do you handle secrets in GitHub Actions?**

"We store secrets in GitHub's encrypted secrets store — under repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. They're referenced in the YAML as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`. They're never exposed in logs and can't be read back after being set. For production, you'd integrate with AWS Secrets Manager or Vault for more advanced rotation and access control."

**Q: What is the `needs:` keyword in GitHub Actions?**

"By default, jobs run in parallel. `needs:` creates a dependency between jobs — the dependent job only starts after the specified job completes successfully. If the upstream job fails, the dependent job is skipped automatically. We use it to ensure deployment only happens after the Docker image is successfully built and pushed."

**Q: Walk me through a CI/CD pipeline you've built.**

"I built a pipeline for a Flask-MongoDB application. On every push to master, GitHub Actions triggers. The first job checks out the code, logs into Docker Hub, builds the Docker image, and pushes it with the `latest` tag. The second job depends on the first — it SSHs into an EC2 instance, pulls the new image, stops the old container, and starts a new one with environment variables passed as secrets. The whole pipeline takes about 2-3 minutes from push to live deployment."
