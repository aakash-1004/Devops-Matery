## What is CI/CD?

**CI — Continuous Integration:**
Every code push automatically runs tests and builds the app. Catches bugs before they reach production. No more "works on my machine."

**CD — Continuous Delivery/Deployment:**
After CI passes, automatically deploys the app to staging or production.

**Without CI/CD:**
```
Developer writes code
      │ manual
      ▼
Runs tests locally (maybe)
      │ manual
      ▼
Builds Docker image manually
      │ manual
      ▼
Pushes to registry manually
      │ manual
      ▼
Deploys manually
```

**With CI/CD:**
```
Developer pushes code
      │ automatic
      ▼
Everything else happens automatically
```

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub's built-in CI/CD platform. Free for public repos, 2000 minutes/month for private repos.

**Key concepts:**

**Workflow** — the entire automation pipeline. Defined in a YAML file inside `.github/workflows/`.

**Trigger** — what starts the workflow. Push, PR, schedule, manual, etc.

**Job** — a unit of work that runs on a fresh VM. Multiple jobs can run in parallel or sequentially.

**Step** — a single task inside a job. Either runs a shell command or uses a pre-built Action.

**Action** — a reusable pre-built step from GitHub Marketplace. Like `actions/checkout`, `docker/login-action`.

**Runner** — the VM that executes the job. GitHub provides Ubuntu, Windows, Mac runners for free.

**Secret** — encrypted variables stored in GitHub. Used for passwords, tokens — never exposed in logs.

## Workflow File Structure

Location: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI — Build and Push Docker Image   # workflow name (shown in Actions tab)

on:                          # triggers
  push:
    branches: [ main ]       # run on push to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]       # run on PRs targeting main

jobs:                        # one or more jobs
  test:                      # job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # runner type — fresh Ubuntu VM

    steps:                   # tasks inside this job
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3    # pre-built action

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'     # input to the action

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt   # shell command

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest test_app.py -v

  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test              # only run if test job passes

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}   # reads GitHub secret
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: .           # build context = current directory
        push: true           # actually push (false = just build)
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/taskmanager:latest
```

## Key YAML Fields Explained

### `on` — Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]        # only main branch pushes
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]        # PRs targeting main
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'      # runs daily at 2am UTC
  workflow_dispatch:          # manual trigger from GitHub UI
```

### `runs-on` — Runner Types

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # Linux (most common, cheapest)
runs-on: windows-latest   # Windows
runs-on: macos-latest     # Mac
```

### `uses` vs `run`

```yaml
# uses — pre-built action from GitHub Marketplace
- uses: actions/checkout@v3

# run — raw shell command
- run: pip install -r requirements.txt
- run: |                    # multi-line command
    echo "line 1"
    echo "line 2"
```

### `needs` — Job Dependencies

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]

  build:
    needs: test             # build only runs if test passes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]

  deploy:
    needs: [test, build]    # deploy only runs if both pass
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]
```

### `${{ secrets.NAME }}` — Secrets

Secrets are encrypted variables stored in GitHub:
- GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
- Referenced as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`
- Never shown in logs — displayed as `***`

## The Pipeline We Built

```
git push to main
      │
      ▼
GitHub Actions triggers ci.yml
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   test job      │  runs-on: ubuntu-latest (fresh VM)
│                 │
│ 1. Checkout     │  clone repo onto runner
│ 2. Setup Python │  install Python 3.12
│ 3. pip install  │  install dependencies
│ 4. pytest       │  run tests
└────────┬────────┘
         │ only if all tests pass
         ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  build-and-push job │  new fresh VM
│                     │
│ 1. Checkout         │  clone repo again
│ 2. Docker Hub login │  authenticate with secrets
│ 3. Build & Push     │  build image, push to Docker Hub
└─────────────────────┘
```

**If tests fail:** `build-and-push` is skipped. Bad code never reaches Docker Hub.

## Pipeline Gate — Proven in Lab

Intentionally broke test:
```python
assert response.json['status'] == 'broken'  # wrong value
```

Result:
- `test` job → ❌ Failed
- `build-and-push` → ⬛ Skipped

This is the core value of CI — bad code can't reach production.

---

## Secrets Setup

1. Docker Hub → Account Settings → Security → New Access Token (Read & Write)
2. GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` = your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` = access token from step 1

**Why secrets instead of hardcoding:**
- Secrets are encrypted at rest
- Never shown in logs
- Can be rotated without changing code
- Different values per environment (dev/staging/prod)

---

## Common Triggers

| Trigger | Use Case |
|---------|---------|
| `push` to main | Deploy to production |
| `pull_request` | Run tests on every PR |
| `schedule` | Nightly builds, cleanup jobs |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual deployment |
| `release` | Publish when a version tag is created |

---

## Actions vs Steps

**Pre-built Actions (uses:)** — from GitHub Marketplace:
```yaml
actions/checkout@v3          # clone repo
actions/setup-python@v4      # install Python
docker/login-action@v3       # Docker Hub login
docker/build-push-action@v5  # build and push image
```

Always pin to a version (`@v3`, `@v4`) — never use `@latest` in production. Versions can introduce breaking changes.

## Common Gotchas

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Push rejected for workflow file | PAT missing `workflow` scope | Regenerate token with `workflow` scope |
| Secrets not found | Wrong secret name | Check exact name in Settings → Secrets |
| Tests pass locally, fail in CI | Missing dependency in requirements.txt | Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` |
| Docker push fails | Wrong token permissions | Use Read & Write token, not Read-only |

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What is CI/CD and why does it matter?"**
> "CI stands for Continuous Integration — every code push automatically runs tests and builds the app. CD is Continuous Delivery — after CI passes, the app is automatically deployed. It matters because it removes manual steps that are error-prone and slow. Without CI/CD, developers manually run tests, build images, and deploy — which leads to 'works on my machine' problems. With CI/CD, every push is validated and deployed consistently in seconds."

**Q: "Walk me through your GitHub Actions pipeline."**
> "My pipeline has two jobs. The first job runs tests — it checks out the code, sets up Python, installs dependencies from requirements.txt, and runs pytest. If any test fails, the pipeline stops there. The second job has `needs: test` which means it only runs if the first job passes. It logs into Docker Hub using secrets, builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile, and pushes it to the registry. The whole pipeline runs in about 40 seconds on every push to main."

**Q: "How do you handle secrets in CI/CD?"**
> "I store secrets in GitHub's encrypted secrets store — never in the code or workflow YAML. They're referenced as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in the workflow and show up as `***` in logs. For Docker Hub I use an access token with minimal permissions — Read & Write only, not admin. For AWS I'd use short-lived credentials via OIDC rather than long-lived access keys."
