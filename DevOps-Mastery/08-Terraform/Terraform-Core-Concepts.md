## What Problem Terraform Solves

Manual infrastructure (CLI, console) problems:
- Can't reproduce exactly
- No history of changes
- One wrong click = production incident
- Onboarding new environment takes hours

Terraform = Infrastructure as Code. Write code that describes infrastructure. Terraform creates, updates, destroys it automatically.

```bash
# Instead of 10+ CLI commands
terraform apply   # done
```

---

## Core Concepts

**Provider** — plugin that talks to a cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, K8s)
**Resource** — a piece of infrastructure (EC2, S3, VPC, Security Group)
**State** — Terraform's memory. Tracks what it created in `terraform.tfstate`
**Plan** — preview what will change before changing it
**Apply** — actually create/update infrastructure
**Destroy** — delete everything Terraform manages

---

## The Workflow

```
Write .tf files
      │
      ▼
terraform init      → download provider plugins
      │
      ▼
terraform plan      → preview changes (no actual changes made)
      │
      ▼
terraform apply     → create/update infrastructure
      │
      ▼
terraform destroy   → delete all managed infrastructure
```

## File Structure

```
terraform-aws/
├── main.tf                  ← resources (core infrastructure)
├── variables.tf             ← input variables
├── outputs.tf               ← output values
├── terraform.tfvars         ← variable values (override defaults)
├── .terraform.lock.hcl      ← locks provider versions (commit this)
├── .gitignore               ← exclude state + provider binaries
└── terraform.tfstate        ← state file (NEVER commit)
```

---

## main.tf — Three Sections

```hcl
# 1. terraform block — which plugins to use
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

# 2. provider block — configure the plugin
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# 3. resource blocks — actual infrastructure
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "taskmanager_bucket" {
  bucket = "taskmanager-terraform-${var.account_id}"
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```

**Resource naming:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "taskmanager_bucket" { }
#         ^ resource type    ^ local name
```
- `aws_s3_bucket` — from AWS provider docs
- `taskmanager_bucket` — your name, used to reference in other resources

---

## variables.tf

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  type        = string
  default     = "ap-south-1"
}

variable "account_id" {
  description = "AWS account ID"
  type        = string
  default     = "956179206096"
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
  default     = "dev"
}
```

Reference with `var.variable_name`. Change in one place, updates everywhere.

---

## outputs.tf

```hcl
output "bucket_name" {
  description = "S3 bucket name"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.taskmanager_bucket.bucket
}

output "ec2_public_ip" {
  description = "EC2 public IP"
  value       = aws_instance.taskmanager_server.public_ip
}
```

Printed after `terraform apply`. Used by CI/CD pipelines and other modules.

---

## Resource Dependencies

Terraform automatically figures out creation order based on references:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "taskmanager_sg" { ... }

resource "aws_instance" "taskmanager_server" {
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.taskmanager_sg.id]
  #                         ^ references SG → SG created first
}
```

No need to specify order — Terraform builds a dependency graph automatically.

---

## State File

`terraform.tfstate` = Terraform's memory of what it created.

```
Your .tf files  +  terraform.tfstate  =  what Terraform knows
```

**How plan works:**
1. Read `.tf` files (desired state)
2. Read `terraform.tfstate` (known state)
3. Call AWS API (actual state)
4. Compare → show what needs to change

**Rules:**
- Never edit manually
- Never commit to Git (contains sensitive data)
- In production → store in S3 (remote backend)

---

## terraform import

Bring existing AWS resources under Terraform management:

```bash
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.taskmanager_bucket my-bucket-name
#                ^ resource type + local name       ^ AWS resource ID
```

Used when joining a company with existing infrastructure — import it into Terraform instead of recreating.

---

## user_data — Bootstrap Scripts

Runs automatically when EC2 instance boots:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "taskmanager_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0f11fb0f6d8b520d4"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  key_name      = "devops-key"

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    apt update -y
    apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2
    usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    systemctl enable docker
    systemctl start docker
    git clone https://github.com/aakash-1004/taskmanager.git
    cd taskmanager
    docker compose up -d
  EOF
}
```

No SSH needed — app deploys automatically on boot.

---

## .gitignore for Terraform

```
.terraform/          ← provider binaries (auto-downloaded, platform-specific)
terraform.tfstate    ← state file (sensitive data)
terraform.tfstate.backup
*.tfvars             ← may contain secrets
```

**Commit:** `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
**Never commit:** `.terraform/`, `terraform.tfstate`, `*.tfvars`

`.terraform/` contains the provider binary — 674MB for AWS provider. Recreated by `terraform init`. Same concept as `venv/` in Python or `node_modules/` in Node.js.

## Essential Commands

```bash
terraform init                    # download providers, initialize backend
terraform plan                    # preview changes
terraform apply                   # create/update infrastructure
terraform apply -auto-approve     # skip yes/no prompt (use in CI/CD)
terraform destroy                 # delete all managed resources
terraform destroy -auto-approve   # skip prompt
terraform show                    # show current state
terraform output                  # show output values
terraform import <resource> <id>  # import existing resource
terraform fmt                     # format .tf files
terraform validate                # validate syntax
```

## Common Gotchas

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Push fails (large file) | `.terraform/` committed | `git filter-branch` to remove from history |
| `t2.micro` not free tier | Account type | Use `t3.micro` instead |
| Bucket already exists | Created manually before | `terraform import` |
| State mismatch | Manual changes outside Terraform | Run `terraform refresh` |

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What is Terraform and why do companies use it?"**
> "Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool. Instead of manually clicking through the AWS console or running CLI commands, you write declarative code describing your infrastructure. Terraform figures out how to create, update, or destroy it. The benefits are reproducibility — you can spin up identical environments with one command, version control — infrastructure changes go through code review like any other code, and auditability — you can see exactly what changed and when."

**Q: "What is Terraform state and why does it matter?"**
> "Terraform state is how Terraform tracks what it created. It's stored in `terraform.tfstate` and contains the current attributes of every resource Terraform manages. When you run `terraform plan`, it compares your code against the state and against actual AWS to determine what needs to change. Without state, Terraform would try to recreate everything from scratch every time. In production, state is stored remotely in S3 with DynamoDB locking so teams can collaborate without conflicts."

**Q: "What's the difference between terraform plan and apply?"**
> "`terraform plan` is a dry run — it shows you exactly what will be created, modified, or destroyed without making any changes. Think of it as a preview. `terraform apply` actually executes those changes. In production pipelines, you always run plan first, get it reviewed, then apply. This prevents surprises and gives you a chance to catch mistakes before they hit real infrastructure."
