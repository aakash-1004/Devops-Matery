## Why Monitoring Matters

Without monitoring you find out about problems when users complain. With monitoring you know before users notice.

Key questions monitoring answers:
- Is the app responding to requests right now?
- Is CPU/memory spiking?
- Did error rates increase after the last deployment?
- Which pod is causing problems?
- How long are requests taking?

## The Stack

**Prometheus** — collects and stores metrics. Scrapes your app and infrastructure on a schedule (every 15s by default). Stores data as time-series.

**Grafana** — visualizes metrics. Connects to Prometheus and builds dashboards with graphs, charts, and alerts.

**node-exporter** — collects OS-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk) from each node.

**kube-state-metrics** — collects K8s object metrics (pod counts, deployment status, replica counts).

**Alertmanager** — handles alerts from Prometheus. Routes them to Slack, email, PagerDuty.

```
Your App (/metrics endpoint)
        │ scrape every 15s
        ▼
Prometheus (stores time-series data)
        │ query via PromQL
        ▼
Grafana (dashboards at :3000)
        │
        ▼
Alertmanager (fires alerts when rules triggered)
```

## Key Concepts

### Metrics
Numbers that describe system state at a point in time:
- CPU usage: 45%
- Memory usage: 2.1GB
- HTTP requests: 150/minute
- Error rate: 3 per minute
- Response time: 120ms average

### Scraping
Prometheus visits your app's `/metrics` endpoint on a schedule and reads the current numbers. Like a health inspector checking your restaurant every 15 minutes.

### Time-Series Database
Prometheus stores metrics as sequences of values over time:
```
Time        CPU%
14:00:00    23
14:00:15    25
14:00:30    41   ← spike detected
14:00:45    38
14:01:00    24
```

Enables questions like "what was CPU 2 hours ago?" and "alert when CPU stays above 80% for 5 minutes."

### /metrics endpoint
Plain text format Prometheus reads:
```
http_requests_total{method="GET", path="/health", status="200"} 1523
process_resident_memory_bytes 52428800
flask_http_request_duration_seconds_count{path="/tasks", status="500"} 2.0
```

## Metric Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Counter** | Only goes up, never down | `http_requests_total` |
| **Gauge** | Can go up or down | `memory_usage_bytes` |
| **Histogram** | Tracks distribution of values | `request_duration_seconds` |
| **Summary** | Similar to histogram with quantiles | `rpc_duration_seconds` |

---

## PromQL — Prometheus Query Language

How you ask questions about metrics.

### Basic queries
```promql
# Get all pod info
kube_pod_info

# Filter by label
kube_pod_info{namespace="monitoring"}

# Node CPU usage %
100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

# Available memory %
node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100

# Count pods by namespace
count by (namespace) (kube_pod_info)
```

### Key functions
```promql
rate(metric[5m])          # per-second rate over 5 min window — for counters
avg(metric)               # average across all series
sum(metric)               # sum across all series
count by (label)(metric)  # count grouped by label
sum by (label)(metric)    # sum grouped by label
```

### Error rate query (production use)
```promql
# % of requests returning 5xx errors
sum(rate(flask_http_request_duration_seconds_count{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(flask_http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m]))
* 100
```

## Helm — Kubernetes Package Manager

Helm installs pre-packaged K8s applications called **charts**. Instead of writing 20+ YAML files, one command installs everything.

```bash
# Add chart repository
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

# Update repo index
helm repo update

# Install kube-prometheus-stack
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --set grafana.adminPassword=admin123

# List installed releases
helm list -n monitoring

# Upgrade existing release
helm upgrade prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --set grafana.adminPassword=admin123

# Uninstall
helm uninstall prometheus -n monitoring
```

**Chart:** `kube-prometheus-stack` installs Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager + node-exporter + kube-state-metrics + 20+ pre-built dashboards.

## K8s Object Types Used in Monitoring

### DaemonSet
Runs one pod on every node automatically. Used by node-exporter because it needs to collect metrics from each individual node's OS.

```
Node 1 → node-exporter pod
Node 2 → node-exporter pod (automatic)
Node 3 → node-exporter pod (automatic)
```

### StatefulSet
Like Deployment but for stateful apps needing stable identity and persistent storage. Used by Prometheus because it stores time-series data on disk — must survive pod restarts.

- Pods get stable names: `prometheus-0`, `prometheus-1`
- Each pod gets its own persistent volume
- Pods start/stop in order

| | Deployment | DaemonSet | StatefulSet |
|--|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Use case | Stateless apps | Node agents | Stateful apps |
| Pod names | Random | Random | Stable (pod-0) |
| Storage | Shared | Usually none | Dedicated per pod |
| Example | Flask app | node-exporter | Prometheus |

## Adding Metrics to Flask App

```python
from prometheus_flask_exporter import PrometheusMetrics

app = Flask(__name__)
metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)  # adds /metrics endpoint automatically
```

Install:
```bash
pip install prometheus-flask-exporter
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This automatically tracks:
- Request count per endpoint + status code
- Request duration per endpoint
- Python process metrics (memory, GC)

---

## Pre-built Grafana Dashboards

`kube-prometheus-stack` installs 20+ dashboards automatically:

| Dashboard | What It Shows |
|-----------|--------------|
| Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster | Overall CPU + memory across cluster |
| Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod | CPU + memory per pod |
| Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace | Resources grouped by namespace |
| Kubernetes / Networking / Pod | Network traffic per pod |
| Alertmanager / Overview | Active alerts status |

---

## Accessing the UIs

```bash
# Grafana — port forward to access from browser
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 --address=0.0.0.0
# Access: http://<server-ip>:3000  admin / admin123

# Prometheus
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090 --address=0.0.0.0
# Access: http://<server-ip>:9090
```

`--address=0.0.0.0` — binds to all interfaces so remote browsers can access it (not just localhost).

---

## Managing the Stack

```bash
# Scale down (save resources)
kubectl scale deployment prometheus-grafana --replicas=0 -n monitoring
kubectl scale deployment prometheus-kube-prometheus-operator --replicas=0 -n monitoring
kubectl scale deployment prometheus-kube-state-metrics --replicas=0 -n monitoring
kubectl scale statefulset alertmanager-prometheus-kube-prometheus-alertmanager --replicas=0 -n monitoring
kubectl scale statefulset prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus --replicas=0 -n monitoring

# Scale back up
kubectl scale deployment prometheus-grafana --replicas=1 -n monitoring
# ... repeat for others

# Stop cluster entirely
minikube stop

# Start cluster
minikube start
```

---

## Reading Metrics in Production

When `/tasks` returned 500 errors due to MongoDB being down:
```
flask_http_request_duration_seconds_count{path="/tasks", status="500"} 2.0
flask_http_request_duration_seconds_sum{path="/tasks", status="500"} 60.27
```

This tells you:
- 2 requests failed with 500
- They took 60 seconds total → MongoDB connection timeout
- Immediately points to database dependency as the cause

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "How do you monitor a Kubernetes application?"**
> "I use the Prometheus + Grafana stack, typically deployed via the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart. Prometheus scrapes metrics from the cluster — node-exporter gives node-level CPU and memory, kube-state-metrics gives K8s object metrics like pod counts and deployment status. For application-level metrics I add prometheus-flask-exporter to the Flask app which automatically exposes a /metrics endpoint with request rates, error rates, and latency. Grafana connects to Prometheus and visualizes everything in dashboards. Alertmanager fires alerts to Slack or PagerDuty when thresholds are breached."

**Q: "What's the difference between a DaemonSet and a Deployment?"**
> "A Deployment runs a specified number of replicas anywhere in the cluster. A DaemonSet runs exactly one pod on every node — when new nodes join, they automatically get the DaemonSet pod. We use DaemonSets for node-level agents like node-exporter, log collectors like Fluentd, and security agents — things that need to run on every machine to do their job."

**Q: "How would you alert on high error rates?"**
> "In Prometheus I'd write an alerting rule using PromQL. For example, divide the rate of 5xx responses by the total request rate over a 5-minute window. If that ratio exceeds 5%, fire an alert to Alertmanager, which routes it to Slack or PagerDuty. I'd also set a `for: 2m` duration so transient spikes don't cause false alarms — the condition must be true for 2 continuous minutes before alerting."
