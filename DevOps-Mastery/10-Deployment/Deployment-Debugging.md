## Why Debugging Skill Matters More Than Setup Skill

Setting up a deployment is a one-time task. Debugging broken deployments is something you'll do for the rest of your career.

Production systems fail. Not if — when. A deploy goes wrong at 2am. A customer calls because the site is down. Your job isn't to hope nothing breaks — it's to find the problem fast and fix it fast.

The engineers who get promoted are not the ones who know the most commands. They're the ones who can look at a broken system and systematically eliminate possibilities until they find the root cause. That's a skill you can learn and practice.

## The Mental Model: Layers

Every web request passes through multiple layers before reaching your application. When something breaks, the key question is: **which layer is failing?**

```
Internet
   │
   ▼
DNS — resolves domain to IP
   │
   ▼
Network/Firewall — is the port open?
   │
   ▼
Nginx — is it running? is config correct?
   │
   ▼
App Process — is it running? is it healthy?
   │
   ▼
Database — is it reachable? are queries working?
   │
   ▼
Application Code — is there a bug?
```

When you see an error, start at the layer closest to the user (top) and work your way down. You're trying to find the first layer that's broken — everything below it doesn't matter until you fix that layer.

## HTTP Error Codes — What They Tell You

HTTP status codes are your first clue about which layer is failing. You must know these cold.

| Code | Name | What It Means in Deployment |
|------|------|---------------------------|
| **200** | OK | Everything working |
| **301/302** | Redirect | HTTP → HTTPS redirect, or URL changed |
| **400** | Bad Request | Client sent a malformed request |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid authentication credentials |
| **403** | Forbidden | Authenticated but not authorized, or file permissions |
| **404** | Not Found | Route doesn't exist, or wrong `root` path in Nginx |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Bug in your application code |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | **Nginx running, app not running or not reachable** |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | App overloaded or temporarily down |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | App running but taking too long to respond |

**502 is the most important to understand.** It means: "I (Nginx) got your request, but when I tried to forward it to the app, I couldn't reach it." This immediately tells you the problem is in the app layer, not Nginx.

**504 is different.** The app is running and reachable, but it's hanging — not responding within the timeout. Usually a slow database query, deadlock, or infinite loop.

## The 5-Step Debug Sequence

This is the systematic approach. Go through these in order every time. Don't jump to step 4 before confirming steps 1-3.

```
Step 1: Is Nginx running?
sudo systemctl status nginx

Step 2: Is the app process running?
pm2 list  OR  systemctl status my-app

Step 3: Is the app accessible locally?
curl http://localhost:PORT

Step 4: What do the app logs say?
pm2 logs my-app  OR  journalctl -u my-app -f

Step 5: What do the Nginx error logs say?
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

**Why this order?** You're eliminating possibilities systematically from the outside in. If Nginx isn't running (step 1), there's no point checking anything else — fix Nginx first. If Nginx is fine but the app isn't running (step 2), the problem is clear. Only if both are running do you dig into logs.

---

## Nginx Debugging Commands

```bash
# Is Nginx running?
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Test config syntax — ALWAYS run before every reload
# Never reload without testing — a syntax error takes down the whole server
sudo nginx -t

# Live error log — most useful file for debugging
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Live access log — see every incoming request and status code
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# Is port 80 or 443 actually open and listening?
sudo ss -tlnp | grep nginx

# What's using port 80 if Nginx won't start?
sudo lsof -i :80
```

**Reading the error log:** Nginx errors include the error type, the upstream it was trying to reach, and the client IP. A 502 in the error log looks like:

```
[error] connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream,
upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
```

This tells you: Nginx tried to connect to port 5000 and got "connection refused" — meaning nothing is listening on port 5000. Your app isn't running.

---

## App Process Debugging

```bash
# Check PM2 process list
pm2 list

# PM2 real-time logs
pm2 logs my-app
pm2 logs my-app --lines 200   # more history

# systemd service status (shows last few log lines)
sudo systemctl status flask-app

# Full systemd logs
journalctl -u flask-app -f                    # follow in real time
journalctl -u flask-app --since "1 hour ago"  # last hour
journalctl -u flask-app -n 50                 # last 50 lines

# Is the app actually listening on its port?
curl http://localhost:5000        # direct request bypasses Nginx
curl http://localhost:5000/health # hit health endpoint

# See all listening ports on the server
sudo ss -tlnp
```

## Common Deployment Mistakes and Fixes

### 1. App dies when SSH session closes

**What happens:** You start the app with `python3 app.py`, everything works while you're connected, but users report it's down the next day.

**Why:** The app process is a child of your shell session. When SSH disconnects, a SIGHUP signal is sent to the terminal, which kills all child processes.

**Fix:** Use PM2, Gunicorn + systemd, or Docker. Never run production apps directly in a terminal.

---

### 2. App doesn't start after server reboot

**What happens:** Server had a planned reboot (OS updates) or power outage. App stays down.

**Why:** Forgot `pm2 startup && pm2 save`, or didn't `systemctl enable` the service.

**Fix:**
```bash
# PM2
pm2 startup   # run the command it outputs
pm2 save

# systemd
sudo systemctl enable flask-app
```

---

### 3. SPA returns 404 on page refresh

**What happens:** App loads fine on the home page, but refreshing `/dashboard` shows a 404. Links from other sites to your app don't work.

**Why:** Missing `try_files $uri /index.html` in Nginx config. Nginx looks for a physical file at `/dashboard`, finds none, returns 404.

**Fix:** Add to your Nginx `location /` block:
```nginx
try_files $uri /index.html;
```

---

### 4. Nginx config change not applied

**What happens:** You edited the Nginx config, but the site behavior hasn't changed.

**Why:** Forgot to reload Nginx after editing.

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t           # test first — never skip this
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### 5. Wrong root path in Nginx

**What happens:** 403 Forbidden or 404 for everything.

**Why:** `root` directive points to project root instead of the build output folder.

**Fix:** Check what your build command creates:
- React: `build/`
- Vue/Angular/Svelte: `dist/`
- Laravel: `public/`

Update `root` in Nginx config to point to the correct folder.

---

### 6. .env file missing on server

**What happens:** App crashes immediately on start with errors like "KeyError: 'SECRET_KEY'" or "MONGO_URI not set".

**Why:** `.env` is in `.gitignore` — it wasn't cloned with the repo. You have to create it manually on the server.

**Fix:**
```bash
nano /var/www/html/my-app/.env
# Add all required environment variables
```

This is why you should always have a `.env.example` file in your repo (without actual values) — it documents what env vars the app needs.

---

### 7. Port conflict

**What happens:** App fails to start with "Address already in use".

**Why:** Another process is already using that port.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
sudo lsof -i :3000
sudo fuser 3000/tcp

# Kill it (use the PID from above)
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Or change your app's port
```

---

### 8. File permissions (403 Forbidden)

**What happens:** 403 Forbidden when Nginx tries to serve files.

**Why:** Nginx runs as the `www-data` user and can't read files owned by another user.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Give www-data ownership
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/my-app

# Or make files readable by all
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/my-app
```

---

### 9. Gunicorn module path wrong

**What happens:** `ModuleNotFoundError` when starting Gunicorn.

**Why:** Running Gunicorn from the wrong directory, or wrong module:variable name.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Must be run from the project directory
cd /var/www/html/flask-app

# Must have venv activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Format: filename:flask_variable
gunicorn app:app          # app.py contains: app = Flask(__name__)
gunicorn wsgi:application # wsgi.py contains: application = create_app()
```

---

## Deployment Update Checklist

When deploying an update to production, always follow this order:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Install any new dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Python
npm install                       # Node.js

# 3. Run DB migrations (if applicable)
python manage.py migrate          # Django
flask db upgrade                  # Flask-Migrate

# 4. Build (if applicable)
npm run build                     # Next.js, NestJS, React
python manage.py collectstatic    # Django

# 5. Restart the app process
sudo systemctl restart flask-app  # systemd
pm2 restart backend-api           # PM2

# 6. Verify the app started successfully
sudo systemctl status flask-app
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# 7. Reload Nginx (only if config changed)
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "A deployment just went out and the site returns 502. Walk me through debugging it."**
> "502 means Nginx is running but can't reach the app. I follow a systematic sequence: first I check if the app process is running with `pm2 list` or `systemctl status`. If it's crashed, I check the app logs — `pm2 logs` or `journalctl` — to find why it crashed (usually a missing env var, wrong port, or database connection failure). If the process shows as running, I verify it's actually listening on the expected port with `curl localhost:5000`. Sometimes a process shows running but has silently stopped accepting connections. Then I check the Nginx error log for the specific upstream connection error to confirm it's a port mismatch. Fix the root cause, restart the app, and verify."

**Q: "How do you make a deployment zero-downtime?"**
> "For Nginx config changes, use `reload` instead of `restart` — it applies changes gracefully without dropping connections. For app code changes with PM2, use `pm2 reload` instead of `pm2 restart` in cluster mode — it restarts workers one at a time so there's always at least one serving traffic. For major deployments, blue-green is the standard: spin up the new version alongside the old, run smoke tests, then switch Nginx's `proxy_pass` to the new version. In Kubernetes this is automatic — rolling updates replace pods one at a time by default."
