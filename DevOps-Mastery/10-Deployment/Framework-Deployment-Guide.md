## The Universal Mental Model

Before learning how to deploy any specific framework, lock in this mental model. Every deployment — regardless of tech stack — follows the same logical pipeline:

```
Source Code (your machine)
     │ git push
     ▼
Version Control (GitHub)
     │ git clone/pull on server
     ▼
Server
     │ install dependencies
     ▼
Build (if needed — compiled/bundled apps)
     │
     ▼
Run the Application Process
     │
     ▼
Reverse Proxy (Nginx — sits in front, handles public traffic)
     │
     ▼
Internet ↔ User's Browser
```

Understanding this pipeline is what lets you reason through any deployment, even for frameworks you've never used before. The specific commands change — the logic doesn't.

## Framework Type Determines Everything

The single most important thing to understand before deploying any app is: **what kind of artifact does this framework produce?**

### Type 1 — Static Frontend

**Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte

These frameworks run entirely in the browser. The server has no work to do. When you run `npm run build`, the entire application is compiled into a folder of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

**Deployment:** copy these files to the server. Nginx serves them directly from disk. There is no running process. No Node.js runtime needed on the server after build. Just files.

```
React source code → npm run build → /dist folder → Nginx reads files → Browser runs JS
```

**Key insight:** Static file serving is Nginx's fastest operation. It reads bytes from disk and sends them over the network at near-hardware speed — no interpreters, no runtimes, no dynamic processing.

### Type 2 — Backend API

**Frameworks:** Express.js, NestJS, Flask, Django, Spring Boot, Laravel, Go frameworks

These frameworks produce a **running server process** that listens on a port and handles HTTP requests by executing code. The server must stay alive 24/7.

**Deployment:** start the process with a process manager (PM2 or systemd). Nginx proxies traffic to it.

```
Flask app → gunicorn runs it on :5000 → Nginx proxies :80 → :5000
```

### Type 3 — Full-Stack (SSR)

**Frameworks:** Next.js, Nuxt.js

These are hybrids. They can render HTML on the server (Server-Side Rendering) which requires a running Node.js process, while also serving static assets. They behave like backend apps from a deployment perspective.

**Deployment:** build the app, run it with PM2, Nginx proxies to it.

---

## Deployment Step-by-Step

### React / Vue / Angular / Svelte

No running process needed after build. Nginx serves static files from disk.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
cd /var/www/html
git clone <repo-url> frontend
cd frontend && npm install

# 2. Build for production
npm run build
# React outputs: build/
# Vue/Angular/Svelte output: dist/

# 3. Nginx config
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/frontend
```

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/html/frontend/dist;   # or build/ for React
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;     # SPA routing — critical
    }

    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|ico|svg)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control 'public, immutable';
    }
}
```

```bash
# 4. Enable and reload
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/frontend /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Updating the app:** `git pull` → `npm install` → `npm run build` → done. No process restart needed. Nginx automatically serves the new files.

---

### Next.js / Nuxt.js — Full-Stack SSR

Runs a Node.js server. PM2 manages the process. Nginx proxies to it.

```bash
# 1. Clone, install, build
cd /var/www/html && git clone <repo> next-app && cd next-app
npm install
npm run build           # compiles pages, creates .next/ directory

# 2. Start with PM2 — runs 'npm start' which runs 'next start'
pm2 start npm --name next-app -- start

# 3. Persist across reboots
pm2 startup && pm2 save

# 4. Nginx config
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/next-app
```

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade    $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host       $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

### Express.js / NestJS / Fastify — Node.js Backend

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
cd /var/www/html && git clone <repo> backend && cd backend
npm install

# 2. Set environment variables (never commit .env to Git)
nano .env
# PORT=3000
# DB_HOST=localhost
# NODE_ENV=production

# 3. Build TypeScript (NestJS/TypeScript projects only)
npm run build   # compiles TypeScript → dist/

# 4. Start with PM2
pm2 start dist/main.js --name backend-api
# Plain Express (no build step): pm2 start app.js --name backend-api

pm2 startup && pm2 save
```

**Nginx config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### Flask — Python Backend

Flask is what you've been building with. In production, the dev server is replaced by Gunicorn, and a systemd service keeps it alive.

```bash
# 1. Clone and set up virtualenv
cd /var/www/html && git clone <repo> flask-app && cd flask-app
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set environment variables
nano .env
# FLASK_ENV=production
# DATABASE_URL=...
# SECRET_KEY=...

# 3. Verify it starts (test before wiring up Gunicorn)
flask run

# 4. Production: run with Gunicorn
gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
# workers = (2 × CPU cores) + 1
```

**systemd service:**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Flask App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/flask-app
ExecStart=/var/www/html/flask-app/venv/bin/gunicorn \
    --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Restart=always
EnvironmentFile=/var/www/html/flask-app/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable flask-app
sudo systemctl start flask-app
```

**Nginx config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### Django — Python Full Framework

Django deployment is similar to Flask but has two extra steps: database migrations and static file collection.

**Why `collectstatic`?** Django keeps static files spread across multiple app directories during development. In production, Nginx needs them all in one place to serve efficiently. `collectstatic` copies everything to a single `STATIC_ROOT` directory that Nginx can point to.

**Why `migrate`?** Every time your data models change, Django generates migration files. Running `migrate` applies any pending schema changes to the database. Skipping this on deploy = database doesn't match the code = errors.

```bash
git clone <repo> django-app && cd django-app
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate          # apply pending DB migrations
python manage.py collectstatic    # gather static files for Nginx

gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi:application
```

**Nginx config — serves static files separately:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location /static/ {
        alias /var/www/html/django-app/staticfiles/;   # STATIC_ROOT
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

---

### Spring Boot — Java Backend

Spring Boot compiles your entire application including its embedded Tomcat server into a single executable JAR file — the "fat JAR." You deploy this one file to the server and run it. No separate application server (Tomcat, JBoss) needed.

```bash
# 1. Build the fat JAR
git clone <repo> spring-app && cd spring-app
mvn clean package -DskipTests   # -DskipTests skips test execution for speed
ls target/*.jar                 # your JAR is here
mv target/*.jar app.jar

# 2. Run it
java -jar app.jar               # starts on port 8080 by default
```

**systemd service:**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Spring Boot Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/spring-app
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /var/www/html/spring-app/app.jar
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
SuccessExitStatus=143           # Spring Boot exits with 143 on SIGTERM — that's normal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Laravel — PHP Backend

Laravel is unique because PHP is handled differently — Nginx doesn't proxy to a running process. Instead, PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is the runtime. Nginx passes `.php` requests to PHP-FPM via a Unix socket, which executes the PHP code and returns the result.

Also important: Laravel's web root is the `public/` directory, not the project root. This is a security measure — only the public directory is accessible from the web. All your sensitive code lives outside it.

```bash
cd /var/www/html && git clone <repo> laravel-app && cd laravel-app
composer install --no-dev           # install PHP dependencies
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate            # generate app encryption key
php artisan migrate --force         # run DB migrations
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache  # Laravel writes here
```

**Nginx config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    root /var/www/html/laravel-app/public;   # NOT project root
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```

## Traditional vs Docker Deployment

You've deployed with Docker Compose and Kubernetes. Here's how that maps to traditional deployment:

| Traditional Server | Docker / Kubernetes |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Install Node/Python/Java on server | Runtime baked into Docker image |
| Manage dependencies per-server | Dependencies in image, consistent everywhere |
| "Works on my machine" problems | Same image runs on every environment |
| PM2/Gunicorn/systemd keeps app alive | Docker/K8s restart policies |
| Nginx as reverse proxy | K8s Ingress as reverse proxy |
| Manual scaling (add servers) | `kubectl scale` or HPA auto-scales |
| `git pull` + restart to deploy | `kubectl set image` or ArgoCD sync |

Understanding traditional deployment makes you better at Kubernetes — you understand what each K8s feature is replacing and why.

## Quick Reference — Strategy by Framework

| Framework | Type | Strategy |
|-----------|------|---------|
| React / Vue / Angular | Frontend | Build → Nginx serves `dist/` or `build/` |
| Next.js / Nuxt.js | Full-Stack | Build → PM2 `npm start` → Nginx proxies :3000 |
| Express / NestJS | Backend | Build (TS) → PM2 `dist/main.js` → Nginx proxies :3000 |
| Flask | Backend | Gunicorn → systemd → Nginx proxies :5000 |
| Django | Backend | Gunicorn + collectstatic + migrate → Nginx |
| Spring Boot | Backend | `mvn package` → `java -jar` → systemd → Nginx :8080 |
| Laravel | Backend | composer → php-fpm → Nginx root = `public/` |

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "Walk me through deploying a React app to a Linux server."**
> "Clone the repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run build`. The build step outputs static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a `build/` folder. I configure Nginx to serve that folder as the web root, add `try_files $uri /index.html` for SPA routing so refreshing any route works, test the config with `nginx -t`, and reload Nginx. No running process is needed after the build — Nginx reads and serves the files directly from disk. To update, it's just `git pull`, `npm run build`, and Nginx serves the new files automatically."

**Q: "What happens during a Django deployment that's different from Flask?"**
> "Two extra steps. First, `python manage.py migrate` applies any pending database schema changes — skip this and the code and database are out of sync. Second, `python manage.py collectstatic` gathers all static files (CSS, images, JS from all Django apps) into a single directory that Nginx can serve directly. In the Nginx config you add a `location /static/` block pointing to that directory so static files bypass Gunicorn entirely."
