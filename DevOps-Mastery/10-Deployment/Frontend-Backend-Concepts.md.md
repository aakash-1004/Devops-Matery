## 1. The Core Distinction

> **One question separates everything: Where does the code run?**

| Type       | Runs Where     | Examples                            |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | User's browser | React, Vue, Angular                 |
| Backend    | Your server    | Flask, Django, Express, Spring Boot |
| Full-Stack | Both           | Next.js, Nuxt.js                    |

## 2. Language vs Framework vs Runtime

These three terms get confused constantly. Get them permanently clear.

### Language

**The syntax and rules you write code in.** Defines how you express logic — variables, loops, functions. A language by itself does nothing — you can't "run a language."

```python
# Python is just syntax rules
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"
```

### Runtime

**The environment that actually executes your code.** This is what's installed on the server. This is what consumes CPU and memory.

```
JavaScript  →  Node.js runs it
Python      →  Python interpreter runs it
Java        →  JVM runs it
Go          →  Compiles to binary, no separate runtime needed
```

> **DevOps implication:** When a deployment fails with "node not found" or "python3 not installed" — that's a missing runtime. You install runtimes on the server, not languages.

```bash
# Installing runtimes on Ubuntu
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

### Framework

**Pre-written code that gives your application structure.** Handles routing, request/response, middleware, DB tools. Sits on top of a language. Uses the runtime to execute.

```python
# Without Flask: you handle every HTTP detail manually
# With Flask: routing is handled, you write business logic
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/users')
def get_users():
    return "list of users"
```

### The Relationship

```
You write code in a LANGUAGE
        |
        v
    FRAMEWORK  (optional but almost always used)
        |
        v
     RUNTIME   (installed on the server)
        |
        v
  Operating System (Linux/Ubuntu)
```

### Real Examples

|Language|Runtime|Frameworks|
|---|---|---|
|JavaScript|Node.js|Express, NestJS, React, Vue, Next.js|
|TypeScript|Node.js (TS compiles to JS first)|NestJS, Next.js, Angular|
|Python|Python 3 interpreter|Flask, Django, FastAPI|
|Java|JVM|Spring Boot|
|PHP|PHP interpreter + PHP-FPM|Laravel, Symfony|
|Go|None (compiled binary)|Gin, Fiber, Echo|
|Ruby|Ruby interpreter|Rails, Sinatra|

> **TypeScript note:** TypeScript has no runtime of its own. It compiles to JavaScript, then Node.js runs it. TypeScript only exists at dev/build time.

## 3. Frontend Deep Dive

### The Browser's Three Languages (Non-Negotiable)

The browser only understands these three. Every frontend framework compiles down to these.

**HTML** — structure. What exists on the page. Not a programming language, no logic.

```html
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<button>Click me</button>
```

**CSS** — appearance. How elements look. Also not a programming language.

```css
h1 { color: navy; font-size: 32px; }
```

**JavaScript** — behavior. The only real programming language the browser understands.

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', () => alert('clicked'))
```

### What Frontend Code Does

- Renders what the user sees
- Handles user interactions (clicks, typing, scrolling)
- Makes HTTP requests to the backend API
- Updates UI based on responses (without full page reload)

### Frontend Frameworks

All four do the same job — structure, components, state management.

|Framework|Made By|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|React|Meta|Most widely used, component-based, JSX syntax|
|Vue.js|Community|Gentler learning curve, popular in Asia/Europe|
|Angular|Google|TypeScript-first, opinionated, enterprise-favored|
|Svelte|Community|Compiles away the framework, fastest runtime output|

### The Build Step

Frontend frameworks need a build step because browsers don't understand JSX, TypeScript, or Vue's `.vue` files natively.

```
You write:         React JSX + TypeScript + SCSS
                         |
                   Build tool runs (Vite / Webpack)
                         |
                         v
Browser receives:  plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript
```

**After `npm run build`:** a `dist/` or `build/` folder of static files. Nginx serves these directly. No running process needed.

**Build tools:**

- **Vite** — current standard, fast, modern
- **Webpack** — older, widely used, more configurable
- **Babel** — transpiles modern JS to older browser-compatible JS

---

## 4. Backend Deep Dive

### What Backend Code Does

- Receives HTTP requests from frontend (or other clients)
- Runs business logic (validate, process, calculate)
- Reads/writes to databases
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Returns responses (usually JSON)

### Why You Can't Trust the Frontend

> The frontend runs on the user's machine. The user controls it. They can modify JS in DevTools, send any HTTP request, bypass all frontend validation. **Every security check must happen on the backend.**

```
Frontend says: "I validated the form, it's clean"
Backend thinks: "I don't care. I'm validating again myself."
```

Frontend validation = user experience (instant feedback) Backend validation = actual data protection

### Backend Languages

|Language|Runtime|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|JavaScript|Node.js|Same language as frontend, non-blocking I/O, great for high concurrency|
|Python|Python 3|ML/AI dominant, clean syntax, massive ecosystem|
|Java|JVM|Enterprise standard, banks/insurance run Spring Boot|
|Go|Binary|Fast, low memory, written by Google, DevOps tooling (Docker, K8s, Terraform are Go)|
|PHP|PHP-FPM|Powers ~43% of web (WordPress), Laravel is modern PHP|
|Ruby|Ruby|Rails popularized "convention over configuration"|
|C#|.NET|Microsoft ecosystem, enterprise Windows environments|
|Rust|Binary|Memory-safe, extreme performance, growing in critical services|

### Backend Frameworks

|Framework|Language|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Express|Node.js|Minimal, most widely used, you add what you need|
|NestJS|Node.js/TS|Structured, opinionated, Angular-like architecture|
|Fastify|Node.js|Performance-focused Express alternative|
|Flask|Python|Minimal, you control everything, great for APIs/ML|
|Django|Python|Batteries-included: ORM, admin, auth, forms all built in|
|FastAPI|Python|Modern, fast, auto API docs, ideal for ML services|
|Spring Boot|Java|Enterprise standard, massive ecosystem|
|Laravel|PHP|Modern PHP, Eloquent ORM, Artisan CLI|
|Gin / Fiber / Echo|Go|All lightweight, all extremely fast|

---

## 5. Full-Stack Frameworks

Handle both frontend and backend in one project.

|Framework|Based On|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Next.js|React|SSR + SSG + API routes. Most popular full-stack choice right now|
|Nuxt.js|Vue|Same concept, Vue instead of React|

### SSR vs CSR — Why It Matters

**CSR (Client-Side Rendering) — Standard SPA behavior:**

```
Browser receives: empty HTML + JS bundle
Browser runs JS → fetches data → renders page
Problem: blank screen until JS loads. Bad for SEO.
```

**SSR (Server-Side Rendering) — Next.js default:**

```
Server runs React + fetches data → builds full HTML
Browser receives: complete, ready HTML
Result: instant content, great SEO
```

> **DevOps implication:** SSR means Next.js must run as a Node.js server process (use PM2). A pure React SPA just needs Nginx serving static files.

---

## 6. The API: How Frontend and Backend Talk

Frontend and backend are completely separate programs. They communicate exclusively via HTTP requests.

### REST API Pattern

```
Frontend:  GET    /api/users        → fetch all users
Frontend:  POST   /api/users        → create new user (body: JSON data)
Frontend:  PUT    /api/users/1      → replace user 1 completely
Frontend:  PATCH  /api/users/1      → update part of user 1
Frontend:  DELETE /api/users/1      → delete user 1
```

### HTTP Methods

|Method|Purpose|
|---|---|
|GET|Read / fetch data|
|POST|Create new data|
|PUT|Replace existing data entirely|
|PATCH|Update part of existing data|
|DELETE|Remove data|

### JSON

Universal data format for APIs. Both frontend and backend understand it regardless of language.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Aakash",
  "role": "DevOps Engineer"
}
```

---

## 7. Database Layer

Backend talks to DB. Frontend **never** talks to DB directly (massive security vulnerability).

### Relational (SQL)

|DB|Notes|
|---|---|
|PostgreSQL|Open source, feature-rich, production standard|
|MySQL / MariaDB|Widely used, slightly simpler|
|SQLite|File-based, dev/small apps only|

### Non-Relational (NoSQL)

|DB|Notes|
|---|---|
|MongoDB|JSON-like documents, flexible schema|
|Redis|In-memory key-value, used for caching + sessions, extremely fast|

### ORM

Code that lets you interact with DB using your programming language instead of raw SQL.

- Django ORM (Python)
- Laravel Eloquent (PHP)
- TypeORM (Node.js)
- Hibernate (Java)

> **DevOps implication:** ORMs use migration files to version database schema changes. Run `python manage.py migrate` or `php artisan migrate` on every deploy that includes schema changes.

## 8. Key Terminology Reference

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|SPA|Single Page Application. Loads once, JS handles navigation without full reloads|
|SSR|Server-Side Rendering. Server builds HTML before sending to browser|
|SSG|Static Site Generation. Pages pre-built at build time, not request time|
|CSR|Client-Side Rendering. Browser receives empty HTML, JS builds the page|
|API|Defined set of URLs and data formats for frontend↔backend communication|
|REST|Architectural style for APIs using HTTP methods + URLs to represent resources|
|JSON|Data format APIs use to communicate|
|CORS|Browser security rule blocking cross-origin requests unless backend allows it|
|ORM|Object-Relational Mapper — interact with DB using code instead of raw SQL|
|Migration|Versioned file that applies a DB schema change|
|Environment|Stage of pipeline: Development → Staging → Production|
|Static Files|HTML/CSS/JS/images served directly by Nginx, no app process needed|
|Reverse Proxy|Nginx sits in front of app, handles all public traffic, forwards to app|
|Build Artifact|Output of build process — what you actually deploy (dist/, JAR, binary)|

---

## 9. CORS — The Gotcha Every DevOps Engineer Hits

```
Frontend on:  https://example.com
Backend on:   https://api.example.com

Browser blocks the request by default — different origins!
```

The backend must explicitly allow it:

```python
# Flask example
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app, origins=["https://example.com"])
```

> You'll hit CORS errors constantly when wiring up deployments. It's a backend config fix, not a frontend or Nginx fix.

                                                        (dist/ or build/)
```

## 11. DevOps Checklist for Any New App

When you encounter a project you've never deployed before, ask these 5 questions:

- [ ] What language/runtime does it use? → install that on the server
- [ ] How do I install dependencies? → npm install / pip install / composer install / mvn package
- [ ] Does it need a build step? → check package.json scripts or pom.xml
- [ ] How do I run it? → node dist/index.js / gunicorn app:app / java -jar app.jar
- [ ] What port does it listen on? → configure Nginx proxy_pass to that port

**Answer those 5 and you can deploy anything.**

## 12. Interview Answers — Ready to Speak

**Q: What's the difference between a language, a framework, and a runtime?**

> "A language defines the syntax I write code in. A runtime is the engine that executes that code on a machine — Node.js for JavaScript, the JVM for Java. A framework is pre-built structure on top of a language that handles common plumbing like routing and middleware, so I write business logic instead of HTTP infrastructure."

**Q: Why can't you put business logic in the frontend?**

> "The frontend runs on the user's machine, which they fully control. They can modify JavaScript in DevTools or send arbitrary HTTP requests bypassing any frontend validation. All security checks, business rules, and data validation must live on the backend where the user has no access."

**Q: What's the difference between SSR and CSR, and why does it affect deployment?**

> "CSR sends an empty HTML page and builds everything in the browser with JavaScript — user sees a blank screen until JS loads. SSR runs on the server, builds the full HTML before sending it, so content appears immediately. For deployment it matters because a CSR app like React produces static files Nginx serves directly. An SSR app like Next.js runs a persistent Node.js process that Nginx proxies to."

**Q: What's CORS and how do you fix it?**

> "CORS is a browser security rule that blocks requests from one origin to a different origin by default. When frontend and backend are on different domains or ports, the browser blocks the request. The fix is on the backend — add CORS headers allowing the frontend's origin. It's not an Nginx fix and not a frontend fix."
