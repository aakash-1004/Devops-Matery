## What Problem Does Nginx Solve?

When you build a web application, it runs on your machine (or a server) on some internal port — like Flask on port 5000, Node.js on port 3000, or Spring Boot on port 8080. These are just numbers your app picked. The internet doesn't know or care about them.

The internet speaks on two ports: **80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)**. Every browser, every curl request, every API call defaults to these ports.

So the first problem is: **how does traffic on port 80/443 reach your app on port 5000?**

The second problem is that your application server (Flask, Express, Django) is not designed to face the raw internet. It doesn't handle:
- SSL certificates (HTTPS encryption)
- Serving static files efficiently
- Handling thousands of concurrent connections
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Load balancing across multiple app instances

**Nginx solves all of this.** It sits between the internet and your application, acting as the gatekeeper — receiving all public traffic on port 80/443 and forwarding it to the right place.

## What Is Nginx?

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy. It was built in 2004 specifically to handle the "C10K problem" — serving 10,000 concurrent connections efficiently, which Apache (the dominant server at the time) struggled with.

Today Nginx is used by:
- Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb, WordPress.com
- Over 34% of all websites on the internet
- Almost every production deployment you'll work on as a DevOps engineer

The key insight about Nginx is that it uses an **event-driven, asynchronous architecture** — it doesn't spawn a new thread per connection like Apache does. Instead it handles thousands of connections in a single thread using non-blocking I/O. This makes it extremely memory-efficient and fast under load.

---

## Two Modes: Web Server vs Reverse Proxy

Nginx operates in two distinct modes depending on what you're serving:

### Mode 1 — Web Server (Static Files)

For frontend applications (React, Vue, Angular), after you run `npm run build`, you get a folder of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These don't need any server-side processing — they're just files on disk.

Nginx can serve these files **directly from disk at extraordinary speed** — no Python interpreter, no Node.js runtime, nothing. Just Nginx reading bytes from disk and sending them over the network. This is orders of magnitude faster than having any app server in the middle.

```
Browser → Nginx → reads file from disk → sends to browser
```

### Mode 2 — Reverse Proxy (Running Application)

For backend applications (Flask, Express, Django), your app is a running process that needs to execute code to handle each request. Nginx can't serve these directly — it doesn't know Python or Node.js.

Instead, Nginx acts as a **reverse proxy**: it receives the request from the browser, forwards it to your running app process, waits for the response, and sends it back.

```
Browser → Nginx → your app (localhost:5000) → Nginx → Browser
```

The word "reverse" is important. A **forward proxy** sits in front of clients (like a corporate VPN that routes your traffic through a company server). A **reverse proxy** sits in front of servers — the client doesn't know or care that Nginx is there.

## The Full Request Flow in Production

This is the flow you need to trace when debugging a live incident:

```
User types "example.com" in browser
        │
        ▼
DNS lookup: example.com → 13.126.234.226 (your server IP)
        │
        ▼
TCP connection on port 80 or 443
        │
        ▼
Nginx receives the request
(listening on port 80/443 — the only process allowed on these ports)
        │
        ├─── Static file? → Read from disk → Send directly
        │
        └─── Dynamic request? → Forward to app (localhost:5000)
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                App processes request
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                DB query (if needed)
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                App sends response to Nginx
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                Nginx forwards to user
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                Browser renders page
```

## Why Not Expose Your App Directly?

This is a common beginner question. If Flask runs on port 5000, why not just open port 5000 to the internet?

**Reason 1 — Security hardening.** Nginx has been battle-tested for decades handling malicious traffic. Your Flask app hasn't. Nginx can block bad requests before they ever reach your code.

**Reason 2 — SSL termination.** HTTPS encryption/decryption is computationally expensive. Nginx handles it once at the edge so your app receives plain HTTP internally. Your app code stays simple.

**Reason 3 — Performance.** Nginx buffers slow client connections so your app process isn't blocked waiting for a slow mobile user to download a large response. Your app handles the request quickly and moves on.

**Reason 4 — Load balancing.** When you scale to multiple instances of your app, Nginx distributes traffic across them. Your app doesn't need to know it's one of many.

**Reason 5 — Port 80/443 requires root.** Ports below 1024 require root privileges on Linux. Running your app as root is a massive security risk. Nginx runs as root to bind port 80/443, but your app runs as an unprivileged user on a high port.

## What Nginx Does — The Full List

- **Reverse proxy** — forwards requests from port 80/443 to your app's internal port
- **Static file server** — serves HTML/CSS/JS directly from disk
- **SSL termination** — handles HTTPS encryption/decryption
- **Load balancer** — distributes traffic across multiple app instances
- **Rate limiting** — limits requests per IP to protect against abuse and DDoS
- **Caching** — stores responses in memory to avoid hitting your app for repeated requests
- **Compression** — gzip compresses responses before sending to reduce bandwidth
- **Buffering** — absorbs slow clients so your app isn't blocked
- **Access control** — block specific IPs or require authentication

## Install & Core Commands

```bash
# Install on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y

# Start / stop / restart
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx    # full restart — brief downtime
sudo systemctl reload nginx     # graceful config reload — no downtime

# ALWAYS test config syntax before applying
sudo nginx -t

# Check status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Enable autostart on server reboot
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

**Reload vs Restart — critical distinction:**
- `reload` — Nginx reads the new config and applies it gracefully. Existing connections are not dropped. Use this in production always.
- `restart` — Nginx fully stops then starts. Existing connections are dropped. Brief downtime. Only use if the process is completely stuck.

## Config File Structure

Nginx on Ubuntu/Debian uses a split config structure that separates available configs from active configs:

```
/etc/nginx/
├── nginx.conf                  # main config (global settings, rarely edited)
├── sites-available/            # all your virtual host configs live here
│   ├── default                 # the default site (shows Nginx welcome page)
│   └── my-app                  # your custom app config
└── sites-enabled/              # symlinks to active configs only
    └── my-app -> ../sites-available/my-app
```

**The pattern:** write your config in `sites-available/`, then create a symlink in `sites-enabled/` to activate it. This separation means you can disable a site by removing the symlink without deleting the config — useful for maintenance or rollback.

```bash
# Enable a site (create symlink)
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Disable a site (remove symlink, config file stays)
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/my-app
```

---

## Config Blocks Explained

### Virtual Host (server block)

Every site or application you host gets its own `server {}` block. This is Nginx's way of saying "for requests coming in for this domain/port, do this."

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;                              # which port to listen on
    server_name example.com www.example.com; # which domain names to match
    
    # ... your config here
}
```

### Serving Static Files (Frontend)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    root /var/www/html/frontend/dist;   # where your built files live
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;     # SPA routing fallback (explained below)
    }

    # Cache static assets aggressively (images, JS, CSS)
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control 'public, immutable';
    }
}
```

### Reverse Proxy (Backend Application)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;   # forward to your app
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Pass client information to your app
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket support (needed for Next.js hot reload, Socket.io, etc.)
        proxy_set_header Upgrade    $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    }
}
```

**Why `proxy_set_header`?** When Nginx forwards a request to your app, the original request headers (like the client's real IP address) are lost — your app would see Nginx's IP, not the user's. These headers preserve that information so your app knows the real client IP, protocol, and hostname.

---

## `try_files $uri /index.html` — Why It Exists

This is one of the most important Nginx directives for modern web apps, and also one of the most misunderstood.

**The problem:** Single-Page Applications (React, Vue, Angular) do all their routing in the browser with JavaScript. The server only has one real file: `index.html`. All routes like `/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/settings` exist only in JavaScript — there are no actual files for them on disk.

When a user bookmarks `example.com/dashboard` and opens it directly, their browser asks Nginx for the file at `/dashboard`. Nginx looks for a file called `dashboard` in your web root, finds nothing, and returns a 404 error. The app never even loads.

**The solution:** `try_files $uri /index.html` tells Nginx:
1. First, try to serve the URL as a real file on disk (`$uri`)
2. If no file exists at that path, serve `index.html` instead

When `index.html` loads, the JavaScript router reads the URL (`/dashboard`) and renders the correct component. The user sees what they expected. **Skip this and your SPA breaks on every direct URL visit or page refresh.**

---

## SSL/HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Every production site must run HTTPS. Without it, browsers show "Not Secure" warnings, search engines penalize your ranking, and data travels unencrypted.

Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates. Certbot automates the entire process — obtaining the certificate, configuring Nginx, and setting up auto-renewal.

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y

# Obtain and auto-configure SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com

# Test auto-renewal (certificates expire every 90 days)
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# Certbot adds a systemd timer for automatic renewal
systemctl status certbot.timer
```

After running Certbot, your Nginx config automatically gets:
- A new `listen 443 ssl` server block with your certificate paths
- An HTTP to HTTPS redirect (port 80 → 443)
- Your app doesn't change — SSL is terminated at Nginx

---

## Port Conventions

These are the standard defaults. Knowing them lets you configure Nginx correctly without guessing.

| Service | Default Port |
|---------|-------------|
| Nginx HTTP | 80 |
| Nginx HTTPS | 443 |
| Node.js / Express / Next.js | 3000 |
| Flask | 5000 |
| Django (Gunicorn) | 8000 |
| Spring Boot | 8080 |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 |
| MongoDB | 27017 |
| Redis | 6379 |

---

## Debugging Nginx

When something breaks, this is the order to check:

```bash
# 1. Is Nginx running?
sudo systemctl status nginx

# 2. Test config syntax — always before reload
sudo nginx -t

# 3. Live error log — most useful for debugging
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# 4. Live access log — see every incoming request
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# 5. Is port 80/443 actually open?
sudo ss -tlnp | grep nginx

# 6. Is your app running on its expected port?
curl http://localhost:3000
sudo ss -tlnp | grep 3000

# 7. What's using port 80 if Nginx won't start?
sudo lsof -i :80
```

---

## Common Errors

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| 502 Bad Gateway | Nginx can't reach your app | App process not running — check `pm2 list`, `systemctl status`, `curl localhost:PORT` |
| 504 Gateway Timeout | App running but too slow/hung | Check app logs, DB connection, memory usage |
| 403 Forbidden | Nginx can't read files | `sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/html/myapp` |
| 404 Not Found | File/route not found | Check `root` path, add `try_files` for SPA |
| Port 80 already in use | Another process on port 80 | `sudo lsof -i :80` to find and stop it |

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "What is Nginx and what does it do?"**
> "Nginx is a high-performance reverse proxy and web server. In production it sits between the internet and your application, handling all public traffic on port 80/443. For frontend apps it serves static files directly from disk — much faster than going through an app server. For backend apps it proxies requests to the running process on its internal port. It also handles SSL termination, load balancing, rate limiting, and compression. Most production deployments use Nginx as the entry point regardless of the tech stack behind it."

**Q: "Why can't you just expose your Flask app directly on port 5000?"**
> "A few reasons. Port 80/443 requires root privileges on Linux — running your app as root is a security risk. Flask's dev server isn't designed for production traffic — it's single-threaded and lacks hardening against malicious requests. You'd also lose SSL termination, static file serving, load balancing, and rate limiting. Nginx handles all of that at the edge so your app can stay simple and focused on business logic."

**Q: "A 502 Bad Gateway appears. What do you do?"**
> "502 means Nginx is running but can't reach the upstream app. I check if the app process is running with `pm2 list` or `systemctl status`. Then I verify it's actually listening on the expected port with `curl localhost:3000`. If the process is running but still 502, I check the Nginx error log for the specific upstream connection error and confirm the `proxy_pass` port matches where the app is actually listening."
