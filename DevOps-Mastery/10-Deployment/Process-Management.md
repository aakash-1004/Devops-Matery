## What Is a Process?

When you run `python3 app.py` or `node server.js`, the operating system creates a **process** — an instance of your program running in memory with its own CPU time, memory space, and file handles.

Every process has:
- A **PID** (Process ID) — a number the OS uses to track it
- A **parent process** — the shell that started it
- **stdin/stdout/stderr** — input/output channels
- A **state** — running, sleeping, stopped, or zombie

When you type a command in your terminal, the shell creates a child process to run it. When you close the terminal (or disconnect SSH), the shell process dies — and all its child processes die with it. This is why your app stops when you close the SSH session.

---

## The Problem: Apps Die Without Process Management

This is the most common mistake beginners make when first deploying to a server.

```bash
# You SSH into your server
ssh ubuntu@13.126.234.226

# You start your app
python3 app.py    # app is running on port 5000

# You close your laptop / SSH disconnects
# SIGHUP signal sent to terminal
# Terminal dies
# All child processes (including your app) die
# App is gone. Users see "Connection Refused"
```

The same happens if your app crashes — a bug, an out-of-memory condition, an unhandled exception — the process dies and nobody restarts it.

**Process managers solve this.** They run your app as a background daemon that:
- Keeps running after SSH disconnect
- Automatically restarts on crash
- Starts automatically when the server reboots
- Provides centralized log collection
- Monitors CPU and memory usage

## PM2 — The Node.js Standard

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is the go-to process manager for Node.js applications. It was built specifically for Node.js and understands its ecosystem — npm scripts, cluster mode, zero-downtime reloads.

**Why PM2 for Node.js specifically?**
Node.js is single-threaded — one process uses one CPU core. PM2's cluster mode can spawn multiple Node.js processes to use all available CPU cores, load balancing requests across them automatically. This is unique to Node.js and why PM2 exists.

### Install & Start

```bash
# Install globally (available system-wide)
npm install -g pm2

# Start a plain Node.js app
pm2 start app.js --name my-app

# Start using an npm script (Next.js, NestJS — uses package.json "start" script)
pm2 start npm --name next-app -- start

# Start compiled TypeScript output
pm2 start dist/main.js --name backend-api

# Start with cluster mode (use all CPU cores)
pm2 start app.js --name my-app -i max
```

### Essential Commands

```bash
# See all processes and their status
pm2 list

# Stream logs in real time
pm2 logs my-app

# Last 100 log lines
pm2 logs my-app --lines 100

# Restart a process (brief downtime)
pm2 restart my-app

# Reload without downtime (cluster mode only)
pm2 reload my-app

# Stop (keeps in process list, just not running)
pm2 stop my-app

# Remove from process list entirely
pm2 delete my-app

# Live CPU/memory dashboard
pm2 monit
```

### Persist Across Server Reboots — Critical Step

This is what most beginners forget. After setting up PM2, you must tell systemd to start PM2 on boot:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate the startup command for your OS
pm2 startup
# This prints a command like: sudo env PATH=... pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu
# Copy and run that command

# Step 2: Save the current process list
pm2 save
# Now PM2 will restore your process list on every reboot
```

**If you skip this step**, your app runs fine until the server reboots — then it's gone and you're getting paged at 3am.

## Gunicorn — Python's Production WSGI Server

### Why Flask's Dev Server Isn't Enough

When you run `flask run` or `python3 app.py`, Flask starts its built-in development server. This server is:
- **Single-threaded** — can only handle one request at a time
- **Not concurrent** — a slow request blocks all others
- **Not hardened** — missing production features like graceful shutdown, error handling, request buffering
- **Not safe** — Flask explicitly warns "Do not use the development server in a production deployment"

In production, you need a WSGI server. **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface) is the Python standard interface between web servers and Python apps. Gunicorn implements this standard and is the most widely used WSGI server.

### How Gunicorn Works

Gunicorn uses a **pre-fork worker model**:
1. A master process starts and listens on the port
2. It forks multiple worker processes (copies of itself)
3. Each worker handles requests independently and concurrently
4. If a worker crashes, the master forks a new one automatically

This gives you true concurrency — multiple requests processed simultaneously across multiple CPU cores.

```
Port 5000
    │
    ▼
Gunicorn Master Process (PID 1234)
    ├── Worker 1 (PID 1235) — handling request from User A
    ├── Worker 2 (PID 1236) — handling request from User B
    ├── Worker 3 (PID 1237) — idle, waiting
    └── Worker 4 (PID 1238) — idle, waiting
```

### Worker Count Formula

```
Workers = (2 × CPU cores) + 1
```

- 1-core server → 3 workers
- 2-core server → 5 workers
- 4-core server → 9 workers

The logic: at any moment, some workers will be waiting on I/O (database queries, network calls). Having 2× workers means CPU is never idle while others are waiting. The +1 is a safety buffer.

### Commands

```bash
# Install
pip install gunicorn

# Basic Flask app (filename:flask_instance_variable)
gunicorn app:app

# Production — multiple workers, explicit port
gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

# Django
gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi:application

# With logging to file
gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --access-logfile /var/log/gunicorn/access.log --error-logfile /var/log/gunicorn/error.log app:app
```

**`app:app` explained:** The format is `module_name:variable_name`.
- First `app` = the Python file `app.py`
- Second `app` = the Flask instance variable `app = Flask(__name__)` inside that file

## systemd — The Production Standard

### What Is systemd?

systemd is the init system for modern Linux distributions — it's the first process that starts when Linux boots (PID 1) and is responsible for starting everything else. It manages system services, handles dependencies between services, and supervises long-running processes.

Every production server uses systemd for service management. When you run `sudo systemctl start nginx`, you're telling systemd to manage the Nginx process.

**Why use systemd over PM2 for Python/Java apps?**
- systemd is built into the OS — no extra software to install or maintain
- It integrates with journald for centralized log management (`journalctl`)
- It handles complex service dependencies (`After=network.target` means "start after network is up")
- It's the standard on every Linux server — any sysadmin knows how to use it
- PM2 is Node.js-specific; systemd works for any language

### How a systemd Service File Works

A systemd service file is a configuration file that tells systemd how to manage your application. It has three sections:

**`[Unit]`** — metadata and dependencies
**`[Service]`** — how to start, stop, and restart the process
**`[Install]`** — when to start (which runlevel/target)

### Flask + Gunicorn Service File

```bash
# Create the service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/flask-app.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Flask Task Manager API
After=network.target          # start only after network is available

[Service]
User=www-data                 # run as www-data user (not root — security)
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/flask-app
ExecStart=/var/www/html/flask-app/venv/bin/gunicorn \
    --workers 4 \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 \
    app:app
Restart=always                # restart if the process exits for any reason
RestartSec=5                  # wait 5 seconds before restarting
Environment=FLASK_ENV=production
EnvironmentFile=/var/www/html/flask-app/.env   # load env vars from file

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target    # start in normal multi-user mode (standard)
```

```bash
# Apply the new service file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload      # tell systemd to re-read service files

# Enable: start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable flask-app

# Start now
sudo systemctl start flask-app

# Check status
sudo systemctl status flask-app

# View logs
journalctl -u flask-app -f          # follow logs in real time
journalctl -u flask-app --since "1 hour ago"
journalctl -u flask-app --since today
```

### Spring Boot Service File

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Spring Boot Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/spring-app
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /var/www/html/spring-app/app.jar
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
SuccessExitStatus=143           # 143 = SIGTERM (graceful shutdown) — treat as success

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Environment Variables — The Right Way

Environment variables are how you pass configuration to your app without hardcoding it in source code. This is the 12-factor app principle you already applied in your taskmanager Flask app with `os.getenv()`.

### Why Not Hardcode?

```python
# WRONG — hardcoded in source code
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017/"

# RIGHT — from environment
MONGO_URI = os.getenv("MONGO_URI", "mongodb://localhost:27017/")
```

If you hardcode it, the password is in your Git history forever. Anyone with repo access sees your database password. If you rotate the password you have to change the code and redeploy.

### The .env Pattern

```bash
# .env file on the server (NEVER commit to Git)
MONGO_URI=mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
DB_NAME=taskmanager
FLASK_ENV=production
DEBUG=False
```

```bash
# .gitignore — always include these
.env
.env.local
.env.production
*.key
secrets/
```

### Production Secrets — What Companies Use

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|---------|
| AWS Secrets Manager | Encrypted secrets with automatic rotation. Standard for AWS. Accessed via SDK. |
| HashiCorp Vault | Enterprise, multi-cloud, self-hosted secret store. |
| GitHub Secrets | Inject into CI/CD pipelines. Never exposed in logs. |
| Kubernetes Secrets | Base64-encoded, injected into pods as env vars. |

**Never store credentials in Obsidian notes, plain text files, or anywhere unencrypted.**

## Choosing the Right Tool

| App Type | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Node.js (Express, NestJS, Next.js) | PM2 |
| Python Flask | Gunicorn + systemd |
| Python Django | Gunicorn + systemd |
| Java Spring Boot | systemd |
| Go (Gin, Fiber) | systemd (compiled binary) |
| Any containerized app | Docker / Kubernetes (process management built in) |

## Interview — Ready to Speak

**Q: "Why do we use Gunicorn instead of Flask's built-in server?"**
> "Flask's dev server is single-threaded — it handles one request at a time. If two users hit the app simultaneously, one waits. Gunicorn uses a pre-fork worker model where multiple worker processes handle requests concurrently. The worker count formula is 2×CPU cores + 1. It's also hardened for production — graceful shutdown, proper error handling, request buffering. Flask explicitly warns against using its dev server in production."

**Q: "How do you keep a Node.js app running after SSH disconnect?"**
> "PM2. It's a process manager that detaches the app from the terminal session and keeps it running as a background daemon. It restarts on crash automatically. For boot persistence I run `pm2 startup` to generate the systemd integration command, then `pm2 save` to snapshot the process list. After that, the app survives both SSH disconnects and server reboots."

**Q: "What's the difference between PM2 and systemd?"**
> "PM2 is a Node.js-specific process manager with features designed for Node — cluster mode for multi-core CPU usage, npm script integration, and a web dashboard. systemd is the OS-level init system built into Linux, which works for any language. For Node.js apps I use PM2 because of the cluster mode and developer-friendly tooling. For Python with Gunicorn or Java with a JAR, I use systemd directly — it's more reliable, has no extra dependencies, and integrates with `journalctl` for centralized logging."
